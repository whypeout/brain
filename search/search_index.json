Review the following scenarios.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Consider service requirements. Each service directly deployed into a virtual network has specific requirements for routing and the types of traffic that must be allowed into and out of associated subnets. A service might require or create their own subnet. There must be enough unallocated space to meet the service requirements. Suppose you connect a virtual network to an on-premises network by using Azure VPN Gateway. The virtual network must have a dedicated subnet for the gateway.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider network virtual appliances. Azure routes network traffic between all subnets in a virtual network, by default. You can override Azure's default routing to prevent Azure routing between subnets. You can also override the default to route traffic between subnets through a network virtual appliance. If you require traffic between resources in the same virtual network to flow through a network virtual appliance, deploy the resources to different subnets.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider service endpoints. You can limit access to Azure resources like an Azure storage account or Azure SQL database to specific subnets with a virtual network service endpoint. You can also deny access to the resources from the internet. You might create multiple subnets, and then enable a service endpoint for some subnets, but not others.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider network security groups. You can associate zero or one network security group to each subnet in a virtual network. You can associate the same or a different network security group to each subnet. Each network security group contains rules that allow or deny traffic to and from sources and destinations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider private links. Azure Private Link provides private connectivity from a virtual network to Azure platform as a service (PaaS), customer-owned, or Microsoft partner services. Private Link simplifies the network architecture and secures the connection between endpoints in Azure. The service eliminates data exposure to the public internet.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["az104","azure"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/14/Az%20104%20-%20Configure%20and%20Manage%20virtual%20networks%20for%20azure%20administrators/#create-virtual-networks","title":"Create virtual networks","text":"<p>You can create new virtual networks at any time.

If you place your virtual machine within a subnet or utilize a network interface, you don't have to associate the subnet or NIC with a network security group. This approach allows all network traffic through the subnet or NIC according to the default Azure security rules. If you're not concerned about controlling traffic to your resource at a specific level, then don't associate your resource at that level to a network security group.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider importance of allow rules. When you create a network security group, you must define an\u00a0allow\u00a0rule for both the subnet and network interface in the group to ensure traffic can get through. If you have a subnet or NIC in your network security group, you must define an allow rule at each level. Otherwise, the traffic is denied for any level that doesn't provide an allow rule definition.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider intra-subnet traffic. The security rules for a network security group that's associated to a subnet can affect traffic between all virtual machines in the subnet. By default, Azure allows virtual machines in the same subnet to send traffic to each other (referred to as\u00a0intra-subnet traffic). You can prohibit intra-subnet traffic by defining a rule in the network security group to deny all inbound and outbound traffic. This rule prevents all virtual machines in your subnet from communicating with each other.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider rule priority. The security rules for a network security group are processed in priority order. To ensure a particular security rule is always processed, assign the lowest possible priority value to the rule. It's a good practice to leave gaps in your priority numbering, such as 100, 200, 300, and so. The gaps in the numbering allow you to add new rules without having to edit existing rules.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["az104","azure"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/14/Az%20104%20-%20Configure%20and%20Manage%20virtual%20networks%20for%20azure%20administrators/#view-effective-security-rules","title":"View effective security rules","text":"<p>If you have several network security groups and aren't sure which security rules are being applied, you can use the\u00a0Effective security rules\u00a0link in the Azure portal.

Implement service endpoints to improve the security of your Azure service resources. When service endpoints are enabled in your virtual network, you secure Azure service resources to your virtual network with virtual network rules. The rule improves security by fully removing public internet access to resources, and allowing traffic only from your virtual network.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider optimal routing for service traffic. Routes in your virtual network that force internet traffic to your on-premises or network virtual appliances also typically force Azure service traffic to take the same route as the internet traffic. This traffic control process is known as\u00a0forced-tunneling. Service endpoints provide optimal routing for Azure service traffic to allow you to circumvent forced tunneling.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider direct traffic to the Microsoft network.

Each service endpoint integration has its own Azure documentation page.</p> <p>Expand table</p> Service Availability Description Azure Storage Generally available in all Azure regions This endpoint gives traffic an optimal route to the Azure Storage service. Each Storage account supports up to 100 virtual network rules. Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse Generally available in all Azure regions A firewall security feature controls whether your database accepts communication from particular subnets in virtual networks. This feature applies to the database server for your single databases and elastic pool in SQL Database or your databases in SQL Data Warehouse. Azure Database for PostgreSQL and Azure Database for MySQL Generally available in Azure regions where database service is available Virtual network service endpoints and rules extend the private address space of a virtual network to your Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and Azure Database for MySQL server. Azure Cosmos DB Generally available in all Azure regions You can configure the Azure Cosmos DB account to allow access only from a specific subnet of virtual network. Enable service endpoints to access Azure Cosmos DB on the subnet within a virtual network. Traffic from the subnet is sent to Azure Cosmos DB with the identity of the subnet and virtual network. After the Azure Cosmos DB service endpoint is enabled, you can limit access to the subnet by adding it to your Azure Cosmos DB account. Azure Key Vault Generally available in all Azure regions The virtual network service endpoints for Key Vault allow you to restrict access to a specified virtual network. The endpoints also allow you to restrict access to a list of IPv4 (internet protocol version 4) address ranges. Any user connecting to your key vault from outside those sources is denied access. Azure Service Bus and Azure Event Hubs Generally available in all Azure regions The integration of Service Bus with virtual network service endpoints enables secure access to messaging capabilities from workloads like virtual machines that are bound to virtual networks. The network traffic path is secured on both ends.","tags":["az104","azure"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/14/Az%20104%20-%20Configure%20and%20Manage%20virtual%20networks%20for%20azure%20administrators/#identify-private-link-uses","title":"Identify private link uses","text":"<p>Azure Private Link provides private connectivity from a virtual network to Azure platform as a service (PaaS), customer-owned, or Microsoft partner services.

The virtual networks that connect to an ExpressRoute circuit are part of the same routing domain and can communicate with each other. ExpressRoute connections don't go over the public internet, so your communications with Azure services are as secure as possible.</p> <p>VPNs use the internet to connect your on-premises datacenter to the Azure backbone through an encrypted tunnel. You can use a site-to-site configuration to connect virtual networks together through VPN gateways. VPN gateways have higher latency than virtual network peering setups. They're more complex and can cost more to manage.</p> <p>When virtual networks are connected through both a gateway and virtual network peering, traffic flows through the peering configuration.</p>","tags":["az104","azure"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/14/Az%20104%20-%20Configure%20and%20Manage%20virtual%20networks%20for%20azure%20administrators/#when-to-choose-virtual-network-peering","title":"When to choose virtual network peering","text":"<p>Virtual network peering can be a great way to enable network connectivity between services that are in different virtual networks.

Think about how you can implement virtual machines in Azure.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Consider test and development. Teams can quickly set up and dismantle test and development environments, bringing new applications to market faster. IaaS and virtual machines make it quick and economical to scale up dev-test environments up and down.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider website hosting. Running websites by using IaaS and virtual machines can be less expensive than traditional web hosting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider storage, backup, and recovery. Virtual machines let organizations avoid the expense for storage and complexity of storage management. Recovery typically requires a skilled staff to manage data and meet legal and compliance requirements. IaaS is useful for handling unpredictable demand and steadily growing storage needs. You can simplify planning and management of backup and recovery systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider high-performance computing. Virtual machines enable high-performance computing (HPC) on supercomputers, computer grids, or computer clusters. HPC helps solve complex problems involving millions of variables or calculations. You can support scenarios such as earthquake and protein folding simulations, climate and weather predictions, financial modeling, and evaluating product designs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider big data analysis. Big data is a popular term for massive data sets that contain potentially valuable patterns, trends, and associations. Mining data sets to locate or tease out these hidden patterns requires a huge amount of processing power, which IaaS economically provides.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider extended datacenters.

Unexpected downtime can include local network failures, local disk failures, or other rack level failures.

A virtual machine provides complete isolation from the host operating system and other virtual machines. This separation is useful when a strong security boundary is critical, such as hosting apps from competing companies on the same server or cluster. Operating system Containers run the user mode portion of an operating system and can be tailored to contain just the needed services for your app. This approach helps you use fewer system resources. Virtual machines run a complete operating system including the kernel, which requires more system resources (CPU, memory, and storage). Deployment You can deploy individual containers by using Docker via the command line. You can deploy multiple containers by using an orchestrator such as Azure Kubernetes Service. You can deploy individual virtual machines by using Windows Admin Center or Hyper-V Manager. You can deploy multiple virtual machines by using PowerShell or System Center Virtual Machine Manager. Persistent storage Containers use Azure Disks for local storage for a single node, or Azure Files (SMB shares) for storage shared by multiple nodes or servers. Virtual machines use a virtual hard disk (VHD) for local storage for a single machine, or an SMB file share for storage shared by multiple servers. Fault tolerance If a cluster node fails, the orchestrator on another cluster node rapidly recreates any containers running on the node. Virtual machines can fail over to another server in a cluster, where the virtual machine's operating system restarts on the new server.","tags":["az104","azure"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/14/Az%20104%20-%20Deploy%20and%20manage%20azure%20compute%20resources/#things-to-consider-when-using-containers","title":"Things to consider when using containers","text":"<p>Containers offer several advantages over physical and virtual machines.

Disks are persistent block storage for Azure IaaS virtual machines. Files are fully managed file shares in the cloud. Storage for virtual machine data is provided through Azure managed disks. Data disks are used by virtual machines to store data like database files, website static content, or custom application code. The number of data disks you can add depends on the virtual machine size. Each data disk has a maximum capacity of 32,767 GB. Unstructured data Unstructured data is the least organized. Unstructured data may not have a clear relationship. The format of unstructured data is referred to as\u00a0nonrelational. Unstructured data can be stored by using Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage. Blob Storage is a highly scalable, REST-based cloud object store. Azure Data Lake Storage is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as a service. Structured data Structured data is stored in a relational format that has a shared schema. Structured data is often contained in a database table with rows, columns, and keys. Tables are an autoscaling NoSQL store. Structured data can be stored by using Azure Table Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure SQL Database. Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service.

These\u00a0man-in-the-middle\u00a0attacks can compromise sensitive data or allow for data corruption by the malicious user. Reference stored access policies where possible Stored access policies give you the option to revoke permissions without having to regenerate the Azure storage account keys. Set the storage account key expiration date far in the future. Set near-term expiry times for an unplanned SAS If a SAS is compromised, you can mitigate attacks by limiting the SAS validity to a short time. This practice is important if you can't reference a stored access policy. Near-term expiration times also limit the amount of data that can be written to a blob by limiting the time available to upload to it. Require clients automatically renew the SAS Require your clients to renew the SAS well before the expiration date. By renewing early, you allow time for retries if the service providing the SAS is unavailable. Plan carefully for the SAS start time If you set the start time for a SAS to now, then due to clock skew (differences in current time according to different machines), failures might be observed intermittently for the first few minutes. In general, set the start time to at least 15 minutes in the past. Or, don't set a specific start time, which causes the SAS to be valid immediately in all cases. The same conditions generally apply to the expiry time. You might observe up to 15 minutes of clock skew in either direction on any request. For clients that use a REST API version earlier than 2012-02-12, the maximum duration for a SAS that doesn't reference a stored access policy is 1 hour. Any policies that specify a longer term will fail. Define minimum access permissions for resources A security best practice is to provide a user with the minimum required privileges. If a user only needs read access to a single entity, then grant them read access to that single entity, and not read/write/delete access to all entities. This practice also helps lessen the damage if a SAS is compromised because the SAS has less power in the hands of an attacker. Understand account billing for usage, including a SAS If you provide write access to a blob, a user might choose to upload a 200-GB blob. If you've given them read access as well, they might choose to download the blob 10 times, which incurs 2 TB in egress costs for you. Again, provide limited permissions to help mitigate the potential actions of malicious users. Use a short-lived SAS to reduce this threat, but be mindful of clock skew on the end time. Validate data written by using a SAS When a client application writes data to your Azure storage account, keep in mind there can be problems with the data. If your application requires validated or authorized data, validate the data after it's written, but before it's used. This practice also protects against corrupt or malicious data being written to your account, either by a user who properly acquired the SAS, or by a user exploiting a leaked SAS. Don't assume a SAS is always the correct choice In some scenarios, the risks associated with a particular operation against your Azure storage account outweigh the benefits of using a SAS. For such operations, create a middle-tier service that writes to your storage account after performing business rule validation, authentication, and auditing. Also, sometimes it's easier to manage access in other ways.

When an application is misconfigured or an unintentional bug is introduced, accidental overwrite or damage can happen to a few data blocks. To help protect against these scenarios, you can take a share snapshot before you deploy new application code. When a bug or application error is introduced with the new deployment, you can go back to a previous version of your data on that file share. Protect against accidental deletions or unintended changes Imagine you're working on a text file in a file share. After the text file is closed, you lose the ability to undo your changes. In this scenario, you need to recover a previous version of your file. You can use share snapshots to recover previous versions of the file if it's accidentally renamed or deleted. Support backup and recovery After you create a file share, you can periodically create a snapshot of the file share to use it for data backup. A share snapshot, when taken periodically, helps maintain previous versions of data that can be used for future audit requirements or disaster recovery.","tags":["az104","azure"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/14/Az%20104%20-%20Implement%20and%20Manage%20storage%20in%20azure/#implement-soft-delete-for-azure-files","title":"Implement soft delete for Azure Files","text":"<p>Azure Files offers\u00a0soft delete for file shares.

Microsoft Entra ID\u2019s primary strength lies in providing directory services; storing and publishing user, device, and application data; and handling the authentication and authorization of the users, devices, and applications. The effectiveness and efficiency of these features are apparent based on existing deployments of cloud services such as Microsoft 365, which rely on Microsoft Entra ID as their identity provider and support millions of users.</p> <p>Microsoft Entra ID doesn't include the organizational unit (OU) class, which means that you can't arrange its objects into a hierarchy of custom containers, which is frequently used in on-premises AD DS deployments.

These organizations use AD DS\u2013based credentials for authentication, and Group Policy manages them. When you consider moving these apps to run in Azure, one key issue is how to provide authentication services to these apps. To satisfy this need, you can choose to implement a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) between your local infrastructure and the Azure IaaS, or you can deploy replica domain controllers from your local AD DS as virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. These approaches can entail additional costs and administrative effort. Additionally, the difference between these two approaches is that with the first option, authentication traffic will cross the VPN, while in the second option, replication traffic will cross the VPN and authentication traffic stays in the cloud.</p> <p>Microsoft provides Microsoft Entra Domain Services as an alternative to these approaches. This service, which runs as part of the Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 tier, provides domain services such as Group Policy management, domain joining, and Kerberos authentication to your Microsoft Entra tenant. These services are fully compatible with locally deployed AD DS, so you can use them without deploying and managing additional domain controllers in the cloud.</p> <p></p> <p>Because Microsoft Entra ID can integrate with your local AD DS, when you implement Microsoft Entra Connect, users can utilize organizational credentials in both on-premises AD DS and in Microsoft Entra Domain Services. Even if you don\u2019t have AD DS deployed locally, you can choose to use Microsoft Entra Domain Services as a cloud-only service. This enables you to have similar functionality of locally deployed AD DS without having to deploy a single domain controller on-premises or in the cloud. For example, an organization can choose to create a Microsoft Entra tenant and enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services, and then deploy a virtual network between its on-premises resources and the Microsoft Entra tenant. You can enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services for this virtual network so that all on-premises users and services can use domain services from Microsoft Entra ID.</p> <p>Microsoft Entra Domain Services provides several benefits for organizations, such as:</p> <ul> <li>Administrators don't need to manage, update, and monitor domain controllers.</li> <li>Administrators don't need to deploy and manage Active Directory replication.</li> <li>There\u2019s no need to have Domain Admins or Enterprise Admins groups for domains that Microsoft Entra ID manages.</li> </ul> <p>If you choose to implement Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you need to be aware of the service's current limitations. These include:</p> <ul> <li>Only the base computer Active Directory object is supported.</li> <li>It\u2019s not possible to extend the schema for the Microsoft Entra Domain Services domain.</li> <li>The organizational unit (OU) structure is flat and nested OUs aren't currently supported.</li> <li>There\u2019s a built-in Group Policy Object (GPO), and it exists for computer and user accounts.</li> <li>It\u2019s not possible to target OUs with built-in GPOs. Additionally, you can't use Windows Management Instrumentation filters or security-group filtering.</li> </ul> <p>By using Microsoft Entra Domain Services, you can freely migrate applications that use LDAP, NTLM, or the Kerberos protocols from your on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. You can also use applications such as Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft SharePoint Server on VMs or deploy them in the Azure IaaS, without needing domain controllers in the cloud or a VPN to local infrastructure.</p> <p>You can enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services by using the Azure portal.

The following table describes some prominent characteristics of paired regions:</p> <p>Expand table</p> Characteristic Description Physical isolation Azure prefers at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair. This principle isn't practical or possible in all geographies. Physical datacenter separation reduces the likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both regions at once. Platform-provided replication Some services like Geo-Redundant Storage provide automatic replication to the paired region. Region recovery order During a broad outage, recovery of one region is prioritized out of every pair. Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority. Sequential updates Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially (not at the same time). Rolling updates minimizes downtime, reduces bugs, and logical failures in the rare event of a bad update.

Azure management groups provide a level of scope and control above your subscriptions. You can use management groups as containers to manage access, policy, and compliance across your subscriptions.</p> <p>Things to know about management groups Consider the following characteristics of Azure management groups:</p> <p>By default, all new subscriptions are placed under the top-level management group, or root group.</p> <p>All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to that management group.</p> <p>A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth.</p> <p>Azure role-based access control authorization for management group operations isn't enabled by default.</p> <p>The following diagram shows how Azure management groups can be used to organize subscriptions in a hierarchy of unified policy and access management. In this scenario, the organization has a single top-level management group. Every directory under the root group is folded into the top-level group.</p> <p></p> <p>Things to consider when using management groups Review the following ways you can use management groups in Azure Policy to manage your subscriptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Consider custom hierarchies and groups. Align your Azure subscriptions by using custom hierarchies and grouping that meet your company's organizational structure and business scenarios. You can use management groups to target policies and spending budgets across subscriptions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider policy inheritance. Control the hierarchical inheritance of access and privileges in policy definitions. All subscriptions within a management group inherit the conditions applied to the management group. You can apply policies to a management group to limit the regions available for creating virtual machines (VMs). The policy can be applied to all management groups, subscriptions, and resources under the initial management group, to ensure VMs are created only in the specified regions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider compliance rules. Organize your subscriptions into management groups to help meet compliance rules for individual departments and teams.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider cost reporting. Use management groups to do cost reporting by department or for specific business scenarios.

The following table outlines the support for SQL Server type backups:</p> <p>Expand table</p> Type Description Usage Full A full database backup backs up the entire database. It contains all the data in a specific database or in a set of filegroups or files. A full backup also contains enough logs to recover that data. At most, you can trigger one full backup per day. You can choose to make a full backup on a daily or weekly interval. Differential A differential backup is based on the most recent full-data backup. It captures only the data that changed since the full backup. At most, you can trigger one differential backup per day. You can't configure a full backup and a differential backup on the same day. Multiple backups per day Back up Azure VMs hourly with a minimum recovery point objective (RPO) of 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. You can use Enhanced backup policy to set the backup schedule to 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours (respectively) for new Azure offerings, such as Trusted Launch VM. Selective disk backup Selectively back up a subset of the data disks that are attached to your VM, then restore a subset of the disks that are available in a recovery point, both from instant restore and vault tier. Selective disk backup helps you manage critical data in a subset of the VM disks and use database backup solutions when you want to back up only their OS disk to reduce cost.

Metrics tell you how a resource is performing and the other resources that it's consuming. Logs contain records that show when resources are created or modified.</p> <p>The following diagram gives a high-level view of Azure Monitor. On the left are the data-monitoring sources: Azure, operating systems, and custom sources. At the center of the diagram are the data stores for metrics and logs. On the right are the functions that Azure Monitor performs with this collected data, such as analysis, alerting, and streaming to external systems.</p> <p></p> <p>Azure Monitor collects data automatically from a range of components. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Application data: Data that relates to your custom application code.</li> <li>Operating-system data: Data from the Windows or Linux virtual machines that host your application.</li> <li>Azure resource data: Data that relates to the operations of an Azure resource, such as a web app or a load balancer.</li> <li>Azure subscription data: Data that relates to your subscription, including data about Azure health and availability.</li> <li>Azure tenant data: Data about your Azure organization-level services, such as Microsoft Entra ID.</li> </ul> <p>Because Azure Monitor is an automatic system, it begins to collect data from these sources as soon as you create Azure resources like virtual machines and web apps. You can extend the data that Azure Monitor collects by:</p> <ul> <li>Enabling diagnostics: For some resources, such as Azure SQL Databases, you'll receive full information about a resource only after you've enabled diagnostic logging for it. You can use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or PowerShell to enable diagnostics.</li> <li>Adding an agent: For virtual machines, you can install the Log Analytics agent and configure it to send data to a Log Analytics workspace. This agent increases the amount of information that's sent to Azure Monitor.</li> </ul> <p>Your developers might also want to send data to Azure Monitor from custom code such as a web app, an Azure function, or a mobile app. They send data by calling the Data Collector API.

A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results.

The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to that of Azure SQL Database: databases, tables, and columns.</p> <p>A Kusto query consists of a sequence of query statements delimited by a semicolon (<code>;</code>). At least one statement is a tabular expression statement. A tabular expression statement formats the data arranged as a table of columns and rows.</p> <p>A tabular expression statement's syntax has a tabular data flow from one tabular query operator to another, starting with a data source. A data source might be a table in a database or an operator that produces data. The data then flows through a set of data-transformation operators that are bound together with the pipe (<code>|</code>) delimiter.</p> <p>For example, the following Kusto query has a single tabular expression statement. The statement starts with a reference to a table called\u00a0<code>Events</code>. The database that hosts this table is implicit here, and is part of the connection information. The data for that table, stored in rows, is filtered by the value of the\u00a0<code>StartTime</code>\u00a0column. The data is filtered further by the value of the\u00a0<code>State</code>\u00a0column.

The name is short for \"Bourne\u00a0Again\u00a0Shell.\"</p> <p>A shell is a program that commands the operating system to perform actions. You can enter commands in a console on your computer and run the commands directly, or you can use scripts to run batches of commands. Shells like PowerShell and Bash give system administrators the power and precision they need for fine-tuned control of the computers they're responsible for.</p> <p>There are other Linux shells, including csh and zsh, but Bash became the de facto Linux standard. That's because Bash is compatible with Unix's first serious shell, the Bourne shell, also known as sh. Bash incorporates the best features of its predecessors. But Bash also has some fine features of its own, including built-in commands and the ability to invoke external programs.</p> <p>One reason for Bash's success is its simplicity. Bash, like the rest of Linux, is based on the Unix design philosophy. As Peter Salus summarized in his book\u00a0A Quarter Century of Unix, three of the \"big ideas\" embodied in Unix are:</p> <ul> <li>Programs do one thing and do it well</li> <li>Programs work together</li> <li>Programs use text streams as the universal interface</li> </ul> <p>The last part is key to understanding how Bash works.

The most frequently used wildcard is the asterisk. It represents zero characters or a sequence of characters. Suppose your current directory contains hundreds of image files, but you only want to see the PNG files; the ones whose file names end with\u00a0.png. Here's the command to list only those files:</p> <p>BashCopy</p> <pre><code>ls *.png\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Linux has no formal concept of a file-name extension as other operating systems do.

In PowerShell, cmdlets are built on a common runtime rather than separate executables as they are in many other shell environments. This characteristic provides a consistent experience in parameter parsing and pipeline behavior. Cmdlets typically take object input and return objects. The core cmdlets in PowerShell are built in .NET Core, and are open source. You can extend PowerShell by using more cmdlets, scripts, and functions from the community and other sources, or you can build your own cmdlets in .NET Core or PowerShell.</li> <li>It has many types of commands.\u00a0Commands in PowerShell can be native executables, cmdlets, functions, scripts, or aliases.

A cmdlet can be developed in .NET or .NET Core and invoked as a command within PowerShell. Thousands of cmdlets are available in your PowerShell installation. The challenge lies in discovering what the cmdlets are and what they can do for you.</p> <p>Cmdlets are named according to a verb-noun naming standard. This pattern can help you to understand what they do and how to search for them. It also helps cmdlet developers create consistent names. You can see the list of approved verbs by using the\u00a0<code>Get-Verb</code>\u00a0cmdlet. Verbs are organized according to activity type and function.</p> <p>Here's a part of the output from running\u00a0<code>Get-Verb</code>:</p> <p>OutputCopy</p> <pre><code>Verb        AliasPrefix Group          Description\n----        ----------- -----          -----------\nAdd         a           Common         Adds a resource to a container, or atta\u2026\nClear       cl          Common         Removes all the resources from a contai\u2026\n</code></pre> <p>This listing shows the verb and its description. Cmdlet developers should use an approved verb, and also ensure that the verb description fits their cmdlet's function.</p> <p>Three core cmdlets allow you to delve into what cmdlets exist and what they do:</p> <ul> <li>Get-Command: The\u00a0<code>Get-Command</code>\u00a0cmdlet lists all of the available cmdlets on your system. Filter the list to quickly find the command you need.</li> <li>Get-Help: Run the\u00a0<code>Get-Help</code>\u00a0core cmdlet to invoke a built-in help system. You can also run an alias\u00a0<code>help</code>\u00a0command to invoke\u00a0<code>Get-Help</code>\u00a0but improve the reading experience by paginating the response.</li> <li>Get-Member: When you call a command, the response is an object that contains many properties. Run the\u00a0<code>Get-Member</code>\u00a0core cmdlet to drill down into that response and learn more about it.</li> </ul>","tags":["azure","az104"]},{"location":"blog/2024/11/14/Az%20104%20-%20Prerequisites%20Azure%20Administrator/#locate-commands-by-using-get-command","title":"Locate commands by using Get-Command","text":"<p>When you run the\u00a0<code>Get-Command</code>\u00a0cmdlet in Cloud Shell, you get a list of every command that's installed in PowerShell. Because thousands of commands are installed, you need a way to filter the response so you can quickly locate the command that you need.</p> <p>To filter the list, keep in mind the verb-noun naming standard for cmdlets. For example, in the\u00a0<code>Get-Random</code>\u00a0command,\u00a0<code>Get</code>\u00a0is the verb and\u00a0<code>Random</code>\u00a0is the noun. Use flags to target either the verb or the noun in the command you want. The flag you specify expects a value that's a string. You can add pattern-matching characters to that string to ensure you express that, for example, a flag's value should start or end with a certain string.</p> <p>These examples show how to use flags to filter a command list:</p> <ul> <li> <p>-Noun: The\u00a0<code>-Noun</code>\u00a0flag targets the part of the command name that's related to the noun. Here's a typical search for a command name using\u00a0alias\u00a0as the noun for which we're searching:</p> <p>PowerShellCopy</p> <pre><code>Get-Command -Noun alias*\n</code></pre> <p>This command searches for all cmdlets whose noun part starts with\u00a0<code>alias</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>-Verb: The\u00a0<code>-Verb</code>\u00a0flag targets the part of the command name that's related to the verb. You can combine the\u00a0<code>-Noun</code>\u00a0flag and the\u00a0<code>-Verb</code>\u00a0flag to create an even more detailed search query and type. Here's an example:</p> <p>PowerShellCopy</p> <pre><code>Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun alias*\n</code></pre> <p>Now you've narrowed the search to specify that the verb part needs to match\u00a0<code>Get</code>, and the noun part needs to match\u00a0<code>alias</code>.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["azure","az104"]},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""}]}
