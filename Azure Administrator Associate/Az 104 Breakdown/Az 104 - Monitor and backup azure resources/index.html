<h1 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Information technology workers understand the importance of data to the organization. The need to protect that data drives decisions around storage, backups, and security. Many companies implement policies that dictate backup specifications for frequency, duration of backup storage, and restore policies.</p>
<p>For on-premises scenarios, backup solutions might have included local redundant storage solutions or off-site storage. Scenarios using backup to tape drives and storing offsite come with the resulting delay in restoring the data (because of the need to transport the tapes back to the server rooms and from performing the restore operation). This can result in significant downtime.</p>
<p>These backup solutions might not always address some of the most important considerations, such as security of the backups, the potential for the company to be impacted by a ransomware attack, or human error in the backup and restore operations. An ideal solution would be cost-effective, simple to use, and secure. This is where Azure Backup comes in.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of a backup scenario with a company's servers and workstations on the left, with files and folders, using the Backup Agent to back up the data to Microsoft Azure storage." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-backup/media/architecture-on-premises-mars.png" /></p>
<p>Azure Backup can also address scenarios for your Azure environments, with support for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure VMs</li>
<li>Azure Managed Disks</li>
<li>Azure Files</li>
<li>SQL Server in Azure VMs</li>
<li>SAP HANA databases in Azure VMs</li>
<li>Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers</li>
<li>Azure Blobs</li>
<li>Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible servers</li>
<li>Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible servers</li>
<li>Azure Kubernetes cluster</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-scenario">Example scenario<a class="headerlink" href="#example-scenario" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You're running an application powered by SQL Server. The database is running in an always-on availability group across three Azure VMs. You want to back up the databases using an Azure native backup service. You're looking to store the backup for 10 years in cheaper storage for your audit and compliance needs. You'd like to monitor the backup jobs daily for all such databases.</p>

<p>Azure Backup is an Azure service that provides cost effective, secure, and zero-infrastructure backup solutions for all Azure-managed data assets.</p>
<p>The centralized management interface makes it easy to define backup policies and protect a wide range of enterprise workloads, including Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Disks, SQL and SAP databases, Azure file shares, and blobs.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of Azure Backup architecture displaying workloads at the bottom, feeding upwards into the data plane, and tying into the management plane.

<h2 id="when-to-use-azure-backup">When to use Azure Backup<a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-use-azure-backup" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As the IT admin of your organization, you're responsible for meeting the compliance needs for all the data assets of the firm, and backup is a critical aspect. There are also various application admins in your company who need to do self-service backup and restore to take care of issues like data corruption or rogue-admin scenarios. You're looking for an enterprise-class backup solution to protect all your workloads and manage them from a central place.</p>
<p>Azure Backup can provide backup services for the following data assets:</p>
<ul>
<li>On-premises files, folders, and system state</li>
<li>Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)</li>
<li>Azure Managed Disks</li>
<li>Azure Files Shares</li>
<li>SQL Server in Azure VMs</li>
<li>SAP HANA (High-performance Analytic Appliance) databases in Azure VMs</li>
<li>Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers</li>
<li>Azure Blobs</li>

<h2 id="how-do-recovery-time-objective-and-recovery-point-objective-work">How do Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objective work?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-recovery-time-objective-and-recovery-point-objective-work" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the target time within which a business process must be restored after a disaster occurs to avoid unacceptable consequences. For instance, if a critical application goes down due to a server failure and the business can only tolerate a maximum of four hours of downtime, then the RTO is four hours.</p>
<p>Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of data loss, measured in time, that your organization can sustain during an event.</p>
<p>The following example scenario describes both the RPO and RTO concepts:</p>
<p>Your organization has an RPO of one hour for your customer database, which means you perform backups every hour. If a data-loss incident occurs, you lose not more than one hour of data. When you set RTO to three hours, then if a system failure occurs, you aim to restore access to the database within three hours to minimize the impact on operations.</p>
<h1 id="how-azure-backup-works">How Azure Backup works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-azure-backup-works" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Let's take a look at how Azure Backup works to provide the data protection you need. Particularly, let's look at how the different aspects of the backup service make it easy to back up various types of data, and how it offers security for your backups as well. In this unit, we cover the following aspects of the Azure Backup Service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Workload integration layer - Backup Extension</strong>: Integration with the actual workload, such as Azure virtual machines (VMs) or Azure Blobs, happens at this layer.</li>
<li><strong>Data Plane - Access Tiers</strong>: There are three access tiers where the backups could be stored:<ul>
<li>Snapshot tier</li>
<li>Standard tier</li>
<li>Archive tier</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data Plane - Availability and Security</strong>: The backup data is replicated across zones or regions, based on the redundancy the user specifies.</li>
<li><strong>Management Plane – Recovery Services vault/Backup vault and Backup center</strong>: The vault provides an interface for the user to interact with the backup service.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-data-is-backed-up-and-how">What data is backed up and how?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-data-is-backed-up-and-how" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The simplest explanation of Azure Backup is that it backs up data, machine state, and workloads running on on-premises machines and VM instances to the Azure cloud. Azure Backup stores the backed-up data in Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults.</p>
<p>For <strong>on-premises</strong> Windows machines, you can back up directly to Azure with the <strong>Azure Backup Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent</strong>. Alternatively, you can back up these Windows machines to a backup server, perhaps a <strong>System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) or Microsoft Azure Backup Server (MABS).</strong> You can then back that server up to a Recovery Services vault in Azure.</p>
<p>If you're using <strong>Azure VMs</strong>, you can back them up <strong>directly</strong>. <strong>Azure Backup</strong> installs a backup extension to the Azure VM agent that's running on the VM, which allows you to back up the entire VM. If you only want to back up the files and folders on the VM, you can do so by running the <strong>MARS agent.</strong></p>
<p>Azure Backup stores backed-up data in vaults: Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults. A vault is an online-storage entity in Azure that's used to hold data such as backup copies, recovery points, and backup policies.</p>
<h3 id="supported-backup-types">Supported backup types<a class="headerlink" href="#supported-backup-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Backup supports full backups and incremental backups. Your initial backup is a full backup. The incremental backup is used by DPM/MABS use the incremental backup for disk backups, and used in all backups to Azure. As the name suggests, incremental backups only focus on the blocks of data that changed since the previous backup.</p>
<p>Azure Backup also supports SQL Server backup types. The following table outlines the support for SQL Server type backups:</p>
<p>Expand table</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Usage</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Full</td>
<td>A full database backup backs up the entire database. It contains all the data in a specific database or in a set of filegroups or files. A full backup also contains enough logs to recover that data.</td>
<td>At most, you can trigger one full backup per day. You can choose to make a full backup on a daily or weekly interval.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Differential</td>
<td>A differential backup is based on the most recent full-data backup. It captures only the data that changed since the full backup.</td>
<td>At most, you can trigger one differential backup per day. You can't configure a full backup and a differential backup on the same day.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Multiple backups per day</td>
<td>Back up Azure VMs hourly with a minimum recovery point objective (RPO) of 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours.</td>
<td>You can use Enhanced backup policy to set the backup schedule to 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours (respectively) for new Azure offerings, such as Trusted Launch VM.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Selective disk backup</td>
<td>Selectively back up a subset of the data disks that are attached to your VM, then restore a subset of the disks that are available in a recovery point, both from instant restore and vault tier. Selective disk backup helps you manage critical data in a subset of the VM disks and use database backup solutions when you want to back up only their OS disk to reduce cost.</td>
<td>Azure Backup provides Selective Disk backup and restore capability using Enhanced backup policy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Transaction Log</td>
<td>A log backup enables point-in-time restoration up to a specific second.</td>
<td>At most, you can configure transactional log backups every 15 minutes.</td>
</tr>

<h2 id="workload-integration-layer-backup-extension">Workload integration layer - Backup Extension<a class="headerlink" href="#workload-integration-layer-backup-extension" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A backup extension specific to each workload is installed on the source VM or a worker VM. At the time of backup (as defined by the user in the Backup Policy) the backup extension generates the backup, which could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage</strong>: Snapshots when using an Azure VM or Azure Files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stream backup</strong>: For databases like SQL or High-performance Analytic Appliance (HANA) running in VMs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The backup data is eventually transferred to Azure Backup managed storage in the data plane by using secure Azure networks Network Security Groups (NSG), Firewalls, or more sophisticated private endpoints.</p>
<h2 id="data-plane-access-tiers">Data Plane - Access Tiers<a class="headerlink" href="#data-plane-access-tiers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are three access tiers where the backups can be stored:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Snapshot tier</strong>: (Workload-specific term) In the first phase of a virtual machine backup, the snapshot is taken and stored along with the disk. This form of storage is referred to as a snapshot tier. Restoring a snapshot tier is faster than restoring from a vault, because it eliminates the wait time for snapshots to be copied from the vault before triggering the restore operation. The snapshots of the VM/Azure Files/Azure Blobs/and so on are retained in the customer's subscription in a specified resource group. This container ensures that restores are quick, because the backup/snapshot is available locally to the customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Vault-standard tier</strong>: Backup data for all workloads supported by Azure Backup is stored in vaults, which hold backup storage, an autoscaling set of storage accounts managed by Azure Backup. The Vault-standard tier is an online storage tier that allows you to store an isolated copy of backup data in a Microsoft-managed tenant, thus creating an extra layer of protection. For workloads where snapshot tier is supported, there's a copy of the backup data in both the snapshot tier and the Vault-standard tier. The Vault-standard tier ensures that backup data is available even if the data source being backed up is deleted or compromised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Archive tier</strong>: Customers rely on Azure Backup for storing backup data, including their Long-Term Retention (LTR) backup data, with retention needs defined in the organization's compliance rules. In most cases, the older backup data is rarely accessed and is only stored for compliance needs.</p>
<p>Azure Backup supports backup of long-term retention points in the archive tier.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All tiers offer different recovery time objectives (RTO) and are priced differently.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of the various workloads such as on-premises server, Azure VMs, Azure files, etc. feeding into the data plane where the access tiers are located." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-backup/media/data-plane.png" /></p>
<h2 id="data-plane-availability-and-security">Data Plane - Availability and Security<a class="headerlink" href="#data-plane-availability-and-security" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The backup data is replicated across zones or regions, based on the redundancy you specify. You can choose from locally redundant storage (LRS), Geo-redundant storage (GRS), or zone-redundant storage (ZRS). These options provide you with highly available data storage capabilities.</p>
<p>The data is kept safe by encrypting it and implementing Azure role-based access control (RBAC). You choose who can perform backup and restore operations. Azure Backup also provides protection against malicious deletion of your backup by using soft-delete operations. A deleted backup is stored for 14 days, free of charge, which allows you to recover the backup if needed.</p>
<p>Azure Backup also supports a backup data lifecycle-management scenario that allows you to comply with retention policies.</p>
<p><img alt="Graphic displaying the three security options of Azure RBAC, encryption, and soft delete as icons." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-backup/media/built-in-security.png" /></p>

<p>Azure Backup uses Recovery Services vaults and Backup vaults to orchestrate and manage backups. It also uses vaults to store backed-up data. The vault provides an interface for the user to interact with the backup service. Azure Backup Policies within each vault define when the backups should get triggered and how long they need to be retained.</p>
<p>You can use a single vault or multiple vaults to organize and manage your backup. If you manage your workloads with a single subscription and single resource, you can use a single vault to monitor and manage your backup estate. If your workloads are spread across multiple subscriptions, you can create multiple vaults with one or more vaults per subscription.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of the management plane. The recovery services vault shows the options for backup policies and management with the portal, SDK, or the Command-line interface (CLI)." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-backup/media/backup-vaults.png" /></p>
<p>Backup center allows you to have a single pane of glass to manage all tasks related to backups. Backup center is designed to function well across a large and distributed Azure environment. You can use Backup center to efficiently manage backups spanning multiple workload types, vaults, subscriptions, regions, and Azure Lighthouse tenants.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the Backup center user interface in the Azure portal displaying backup information for Azure Virtual machines related to jobs and backup instances." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-backup/media/backup-center.png" /></p>

<p>Azure Backup is an Azure service that provides secure and zero-infrastructure backup solutions for all Azure-managed data assets. It protects a wide range of enterprise workloads, including Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Disks, SQL and SAP databases, and Azure file shares and blobs.</p>
<p>The main criteria that we're evaluating are outlined in the following table. The table contains some key areas where Azure Backup can provide services to you for data protection.</p>

<h2 id="apply-the-criteria">Apply the criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#apply-the-criteria" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In the introduction, we presented a scenario where your organization might have an application that relies on data from a back-end SQL Server installation. SQL Server is running on three Azure VMs. The data in the backup must be retained for up to 10 years to meet compliance requirements. You also want to be able to monitor the backups.</p>
<p>Before we dive into how Azure Backup can help meet these needs, it's important to understand what's not currently supported. If your three Azure VMs are deployed across multiple subscriptions or regions, you should be aware that Azure Backup doesn’t support cross-region backup for most workloads. However, it does support cross-region restore in a paired secondary region.</p>
<h3 id="can-azure-backup-protect-the-azure-vms-hosting-the-sql-server-instances">Can Azure Backup protect the Azure VMs hosting the SQL Server instances?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-azure-backup-protect-the-azure-vms-hosting-the-sql-server-instances" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Backup is able to back up entire Windows and Linux VMs using backup extensions. As a result, you can back up the entire VM that hosts SQL Server. If you only want to back up the files, folders, and system state on the Azure VMs, you can use the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent.</p>
<p>If your main concern is to only back up the SQL Server data, Azure Backup provides support for that as well. Azure Backup offers a stream-based, specialized solution to back up SQL Servers running in Azure VMs. This solution aligns with Azure Backup's benefits of zero-infrastructure backup, long-term retention, and central management.</p>
<p>Additionally, Azure Backup provides the following advantages specifically for SQL Server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workload aware backups that support all backup types: full, differential, and log</li>
<li>15-minute recovery point objective (RPO) with frequent log backups</li>
<li>Point-in-time recovery up to a second</li>
<li>Individual database-level backup and restore</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Diagram of SQL Server hosted on an Azure VM backed up to a Recovery Services Vaults in Azure Backup. Displayed are also a data path and controls arrow depicting two-way flow for the data path and control path flow from Azure Backup to the backup extension on the VM." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-backup/media/azure-backup-sql-overview.png" /></p>
<h3 id="does-azure-backup-help-with-compliance">Does Azure Backup help with compliance?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-azure-backup-help-with-compliance" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You can implement required access-control mechanisms for your backups. Vaults (Recovery Services and Backup vaults) provide the management capabilities and are accessible via the Azure portal, Backup Center, Vault dashboards, SDK, CLI, and even REST APIs. It's also an Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) boundary, providing you with the option to restrict access to backups only to authorized Backup Admins.</p>
<p>Short-term retention can be <em>minutes</em> or <em>daily</em>. Retention for <em>weekly</em>, <em>monthly</em>, or <em>yearly</em> backup points is referred to as <em>Long-term retention</em>.</p>
<p>Long-term retention can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Planned (compliance requirements)</strong>: If you know in advance that data is required years from the current time, use Long-term retention.</li>
<li><strong>Unplanned (on-demand requirement)</strong>: If you don't know in advance, then you can use on-demand backup with specific custom retention settings (these custom retention settings aren't impacted by policy settings).</li>
<li><strong>On-demand backup with custom retention</strong>: If you need to take a backup not scheduled via backup policy, then you can use an on-demand backup. It can be useful for taking backups that don’t fit your scheduled backup or for taking granular backup (for example, multiple IaaS VM backups per day since scheduled backup permits only one backup per day). It's important to note that the retention policy defined in scheduled policy doesn't apply to on-demand backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also implement policy management to help with compliance. Azure Backup Policies within each vault define when the backups should be triggered and how long they need to be retained. You can also manage these policies and apply them across multiple items.</p>

<p>For monitoring and reporting, Azure Backup integrates with Log Analytics and provides the ability to see reports via Workbooks.</p>
<p>Azure Backup provides in-built job monitoring for operations such as configuring backup, backing up, restoring, deleting backups, and so on. It's scoped to the vault and ideal for monitoring a single vault.</p>
<p>If you need to monitor operational activities at scale, Backup Explorer provides an aggregated view of your entire backup estate, enabling detailed drill-down analysis and troubleshooting. It's a built-in Azure Monitor workbook that provides a single, central location to help you monitor operational activities across the entire backup estate on Azure, spanning tenants, locations, subscriptions, resource groups, and vaults.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For many Azure resources, the metrics data collected by Azure Monitor is displayed on the <strong>Overview</strong> page for the resource in the Azure portal. Consider the overview for an Azure virtual machine that has several charts that show performance metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use Azure Monitor <strong>metrics explorer</strong> to view the metrics for your Azure services and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Azure Monitor begins collecting data as soon as you create your Azure subscription and add resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you create or modify resources, this data is stored in Azure Monitor activity logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance data about resources, along with the amount of resources consumed, is stored as Azure Monitor metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend the data you're collecting by enabling diagnostics and adding Azure Monitor Agent to compute resources. By extending your data sources, you can collect data for the internal operation of the resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Azure Monitor Agent also lets you configure different data sources to collect logs and metrics from Windows and Linux guest operating systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Azure Monitor can collect log data from any REST client by using the Data Collector API. The Data Collector API lets you create custom monitoring scenarios and extend monitoring to resources that don't expose data through other sources.</p>

<p>Let's examine some details about working with activity logs in Azure Monitor.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can use the information in activity logs to understand the status of resource operations and other relevant properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activity logs can help you determine the "what, who, and when" for any write operation (PUT, POST, DELETE) performed on resources in your subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activity logs are kept for 90 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can query for any range of dates in an activity log, as long as the starting date isn't more than 90 days in the past.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can retrieve events from your activity logs by using the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, PowerShell cmdlets, and the Azure Monitor REST API.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Diagram that shows how Azure Monitor activity logs gather information from compute and non-compute resources in Azure." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-azure-monitor/media/activity-log-7d1913ad.png" /></p>
<h4 id="business-scenarios">Business scenarios<a class="headerlink" href="#business-scenarios" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Activity logs can help you monitor your configuration and get details for many scenarios, such as:</p>
<p><em>What operations happened on resources in my subscription?</em></p>
<p><em>Who initiated the operations?</em></p>
<p><em>When did the operations occur?</em></p>
<p><em>What's the current status of the operations?</em></p>
<p><em>What are the values of other properties that can help with my analysis of the resources and operations?</em></p>
<h1 id="query-the-activity-log">Query the activity log<a class="headerlink" href="#query-the-activity-log" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In the Azure portal, you can filter your Azure Monitor activity logs so you can view specific information. The filters enable you to review only the activity log data that meets your criteria. You might set filters to review monitoring data about critical events for your primary subscription and production virtual machine during peak business hours.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot that shows filter options for activity logs in the Azure portal." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-azure-monitor/media/query-activity-log-a92271d9.png" /></p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-activity-log-filters">Things to know about activity log filters<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-activity-log-filters" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let's review some of the filters you can set to control what data to review in your activity log:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Subscription</strong>: Show the data for one or more specified Azure subscription names.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Timespan</strong>: Show data for a specified time by choosing the start and end time for events, such as a six-hour period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Event Severity</strong>: Show events at the selected severity levels, including <em>Informational</em>, <em>Warning</em>, <em>Error</em>, or <em>Critical</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource group</strong>: Show data for one or more specified resource groups within your specified subscriptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource (name)</strong>: Show data for the specified resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource type</strong>: Show data for resources of a specified type, such as <code>Microsoft.Compute/virtualmachines</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operation name</strong>: Show data for a selected Azure Resource Manager operation, such as <code>Microsoft.SQL/servers/Write</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Event initiated by</strong>: Show operation data for a specified user who performed the operation, referred to as the "caller."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After you define a set of filters, you can pin the filter set to the Azure Monitor dashboard. You can also download your activity log search results as a CSV file.</p>
<p>In addition to the filters, you can enter a text string in the <strong>Search</strong> box. Azure Monitor tries to match your search string against data returned for all fields in all events that corresponds to your filter settings.</p>

<p>Let's examine some characteristics of Log Analytics in Azure Monitor.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Log Analytics in Azure Monitor offers query features and tools that help you answer virtually any question about your monitored configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log Analytics supports the Kusto Query Language (KQL). You can create simple or complex queries with KQL, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search and sort by value, time, property state, and more</li>
<li>Join data from multiple tables</li>
<li>Aggregate large sets of data</li>
<li>Perform intricate operations with minimal code</li>
<li>When your Azure Monitor Logs contain sufficient collected data, and you understand how to construct the appropriate query, you can use Log Analytics to complete detailed analysis and problem solving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-to-consider-when-using-log-analytics">Things to consider when using Log Analytics<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-consider-when-using-log-analytics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Some features in Azure Monitor, such as insights and solutions, process log data without exposing you to the underlying queries. To use other Azure Monitor features, you need to understand how to construct queries and apply them to interactively analyze data in Azure Monitor Logs. The following business scenarios showcase the advantages of querying Azure Monitor Logs with Log Analytics.</p>
<h4 id="business-scenario-assess-update-requirements-and-time-to-complete">Business scenario: Assess update requirements and time-to-complete<a class="headerlink" href="#business-scenario-assess-update-requirements-and-time-to-complete" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>An important daily task for IT admins is to assess system update requirements and plan for configuration patches. Accurate scheduling is critical because the patching process relates to SLAs to the business and can negatively affect business functions.</p>
<p>In the past, administrators had to schedule a patch update with only limited knowledge of how long it might take to complete the process. With an Azure subscription, admins can access benefits of the Microsoft Azure platform. Azure collects data from all customers performing patches. Azure uses the gathered data to provide an average patching time for specific updates.</p>
<p>This use of "crowd-sourced" data is unique to cloud systems. It's a great example of how Log Analytics in Azure Monitor can you help meet strict SLAs for your business.</p>

<p>Troubleshooting an operational incident is a complex process that requires access to multiple data streams. By monitoring your systems from the Azure platform, you can easily perform analysis from multiple angles. You have access to data from a wide variety of sources through a single interface for correlation of information.</p>
<p>By tracking changes across the Azure environment, Log Analytics in Azure Monitor can help you easily identify common issues, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abnormal behavior from a specific account</li>
<li>Users installing unapproved software</li>
<li>Unexpected system reboots or shutdowns</li>
<li>Evidence of security breaches</li>
<li>Specific problems in loosely coupled applications</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="create-a-log-analytics-workspace">Create a Log Analytics workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-log-analytics-workspace" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>

<p>To get started with Log Analytics in Azure Monitor, you need to create your workspace. Each workspace has a unique workspace ID and resource ID. After you create your workspace, you configure your data sources and solutions to store their data in your workspace.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot that shows how to create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-log-analytics/media/create-workspace-f37a5b11.png" /></p>
<p>To create your Log Analytics workspace, configure the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Provide a name for your new Log Analytics workspace. The name for your workspace must be unique within your resource group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Subscription</strong>: Specify the Azure Subscription to associate with your workspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resource Group</strong>: Specify the resource group to associate with your workspace. You can choose an existing resource group or create a new one. The resource group must contain at least one Azure Virtual Machines instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Region</strong>: Select the region where you deploy your virtual machines.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The region must support Log Analytics. You can review the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/">regions that support Log Analytics</a>. In the <strong>Search for a product</strong> box, enter "Azure Monitor."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: The default pricing tier for a new workspace is <em>pay-as-you-go</em>. Charges incur only after you start collecting data.</p>
<p>Each Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor can have a different pricing tier. You can change the pricing tier for a workspace and also track the changes.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h1 id="structure-log-analytics-queries">Structure Log Analytics queries<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-log-analytics-queries" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Administrators build Log Analytics queries from data stored in dedicated tables in a Log Analytics workspace. Some common dedicated tables include Event, Syslog, Heartbeat, and Alert. When you build a Kusto Query Language (KQL) query, you begin by determining which tables in the Azure Monitor Logs repository have the data you're looking for.</p>
<p>The following illustration highlights how KQL queries use the dedicated table data for your monitored services and resources.</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration that shows how to build Log Analytics queries from data in dedicated tables in a Log Analytics workspace." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-log-analytics/media/query-tables-f3872e3a.png" /></p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-kql-query-structure">Things to know about KQL query structure<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-kql-query-structure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let's take a closer look at dedicated table data and how to structure a KQL log query.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each of your selected data sources and solution stores its data in dedicated tables in your Log Analytics workspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation for each data source and solution includes the name of the data type that it creates and a description of each of its properties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basic structure of a query is a source table followed by a series of commands (referred to as <em>operators</em>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A query can have a chain of multiple operators to refine your data and perform advanced functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each operator in a query chain begins with a pipe character <code>|</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many queries require data from a single table only, but other queries can use various options and include data from multiple tables.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Azure Network Watcher supports many Azure monitoring tasks and scenarios. As you review these features, think about how Network Watcher can support your Azure monitoring requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider remote monitoring</strong>. Automate remote network monitoring with packet capture. You can monitor and diagnose networking issues without logging in to your virtual machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider alert notifications</strong>. Set alerts to trigger packet capture, and access real-time performance information at the packet level. When you observe an issue, you can investigate in detail for better diagnoses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider NSG flow log diagnosis</strong>. Use NSG flow logs to gain insight into your network traffic. Build a deeper understanding of your network traffic pattern by using NSG flow logs. Information provided by flow logs helps you gather data for compliance, auditing, and monitoring your network security profile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider log analysis</strong>. Diagnose your most common Azure VPN Gateway and connections issues. You can identify issues and use the generated detailed logs to assist your analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="review-ip-flow-verify-diagnostics">Review IP flow verify diagnostics<a class="headerlink" href="#review-ip-flow-verify-diagnostics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>IP flow verify</strong> feature in Azure Network Watcher checks connectivity from or to the internet, and from or to your on-premises environment. This feature helps you identify if a security rule is blocking traffic to or from your virtual machine or the internet.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the IP flow verify feature in the Azure portal." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-network-watcher/media/flow-verify-d136d78d.png" /></p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-ip-flow-verify">Things to know about IP flow verify<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-ip-flow-verify" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let's examine the configuration details and functionality of the IP flow verify feature in Azure Network Watcher.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You configure the IP flow verify feature with the following properties in the Azure portal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual machine and network interface</li>
<li>Local (source) port number</li>
<li>Remote (destination) IP address, and remote port number</li>
<li>Communication protocol (TCP or UDP)</li>
<li>Traffic direction (Inbound or Outbound)</li>
<li>The feature tests communication for a target virtual machine with associated network security group (NSG) rules by running inbound and outbound packets to and from the machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the test runs complete, the feature informs you whether communication with the machine succeeds (allows access) or fails (denies access).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the target machine denies the packet because of an NSG, the feature returns the name of the controlling security rule.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-to-consider-when-using-ip-flow-verify">Things to consider when using IP flow verify<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-consider-when-using-ip-flow-verify" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The IP flow verify feature is ideal for helping to ensure correct application of your security rules.</p>
<p>When you deploy a virtual machine, Azure applies several default security rules to your machine. The security rules allow or deny traffic to or from your virtual machine. You can override Azure's default rules or create other rules.</p>
<p>At some point, your virtual machine might be unable to communicate with other resources because of a security rule. You can use the IP flow verify feature to troubleshoot your NSG rules.</p>
<p>If test runs fail, but the IP flow verify feature doesn't indicate the issue is related to your NSG rules, you need to explore other areas, such as firewall restrictions.</p>
<h1 id="review-next-hop-diagnostics">Review next hop diagnostics<a class="headerlink" href="#review-next-hop-diagnostics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>next hop</strong> feature in Azure Network Watcher checks if traffic is being directed to the intended destination. This feature lets you view the next connection point (or <em>next hop</em>) in your network route, and helps you verify a correct network configuration.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the next hop feature in the Azure portal." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-network-watcher/media/next-hop-d7dde5f6.png" /></p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-next-hop">Things to know about next hop<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-next-hop" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let's review the configuration properties and summary of the next hop feature in Azure Network Watcher.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You configure the next hop feature with the following properties in the Azure portal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your subscription and resource group</li>
<li>Virtual machine and network interface</li>
<li>Source IP address</li>
<li>Destination IP address (If you want to confirm a specified target is reachable)</li>
<li>The feature tests the next connection point in your network route configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next hop test returns three items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Next hop type</li>
<li>IP address of the next hop (If available)</li>
<li>Route table for the next hop (If available)</li>
<li>Examples of a next hop are <em>Internet</em>, <em>Virtual Network</em>, and <em>Virtual Network Service Endpoint</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the next hop is a user-defined route (UDR), the process returns the UDR route. Otherwise, next hop returns the system route.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the next hop is of type <em>None</em>, there might be a valid system route to the destination IP address, but no next hop exists to route the traffic to the target.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-to-consider-when-using-next-hop">Things to consider when using next hop<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-consider-when-using-next-hop" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The next hop feature is ideal for identifying unresponsive virtual machines or broken routes in your network.</p>
<p>When you create a virtual network, Azure creates several default outbound routes for network traffic. Outbound traffic from all resources (such as virtual machines) deployed in the virtual network is routed based on Azure's default routes. You can override Azure's default routes or create other routes.</p>
<p>You might find that a virtual machine can no longer communicate with other resources connected by a specific route. You can use the next hop feature to examine a specific source and destination IP address in your configuration.</p>
<p>Next hop tests the communication between the source and destination, and reports the type of next hop in the traffic route. You can then remove, change, or add a route, to resolve routing issues.</p>
<h1 id="visualize-the-network-topology">Visualize the network topology<a class="headerlink" href="#visualize-the-network-topology" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Administrators sometimes need to troubleshoot virtual networks that they didn't help to create. They might not be fully aware of all the aspects of the infrastructure and configuration.</p>
<p>Azure Network Watcher provides a network monitoring <strong>topology</strong> tool to help administrators visualize and understand infrastructure. The following image shows an example topology diagram for a virtual network in Network Watcher.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the Network Watcher Topology page in the Azure portal." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-network-watcher/media/monitor-visualization-1fb7bd5c.png" /></p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-the-topology-tool">Things to know about the topology tool<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-the-topology-tool" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Review the following characteristics of the network topology capability in Azure Network Watcher.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Network Watcher Topology tool generates a visual diagram of the resources in a virtual network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The graphical display shows the resources in the network, their interconnections, and their relationships with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can view subnets, virtual machines, network interfaces, public IP addresses, network security groups, route tables, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To generate a topology, you need an Azure Network Watcher instance in the same region as the virtual network.</p>

<p>Microsoft Azure provides a robust alerting and monitoring solution called Azure Monitor. You can use Azure Monitor to configure notifications and alerts for your key systems and applications. These alerts ensure that the correct team knows when a problem arises.</p>
<p>You work for a large shipping company that recently deployed several web applications to the Azure platform. Due to a configuration error, the customer-facing order tracker was offline. The issue wasn't identified until customers started complaining that they couldn't track their orders. As a consequence, customer satisfaction with your service dropped.</p>
<p>As your company's Azure solution architect, you need to find a solution that detects problems in your environments in real time. The solution should notify the correct team so it can resolve any problems before your customers notice.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives_2">Learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-objectives_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>

<p>Azure Monitor is a powerful reporting and analytics tool. You can use it for insights into the behavior and running of your environment and applications. You can then respond proactively to faults in your system.</p>
<p>After the downtime that your customers faced, you set up monitoring on your key resources in Azure. With the monitoring in place, you want to make sure the right people are being alerted at the right level.</p>
<p>In this unit, you learn how Azure Monitor receives resource data, what makes up an alert, and how and when to use an alert. Finally, you learn how to create and manage your own alerts.</p>
<h2 id="data-types-in-azure-monitor">Data types in Azure Monitor<a class="headerlink" href="#data-types-in-azure-monitor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Azure Monitor receives data from target resources like applications, operating systems, Azure resources, Azure subscriptions, and Azure tenants. The nature of the resource defines which data types are available. A data type can be a <em>metric</em>, a <em>log</em>, or both a metric and a log:</p>
<ul>
<li>The focus for <em>metric</em>-based data types is the numerical time-sensitive values that represent some aspect of the target resource.</li>
<li>The focus for <em>log</em>-based data types is the querying of content data held in structured, record-based log files that are relevant to the target resource.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Diagram that represents the target resources feeding into Azure Monitor and the two principal signal types: metrics and logs." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/incident-response-with-alerting-on-azure/media/2-azure-resource-signal-types.svg" /></p>
<p>There are three signal types that you can use to monitor your environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Metric</strong> alerts provide an alert trigger when a specified threshold is exceeded. For example, a metric alert can notify you when CPU usage is greater than 95 percent.</li>
<li><strong>Activity log</strong> alerts notify you when Azure resources change state. For example, an activity log alert can notify you when a resource is deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Log</strong> alerts are based on things written to log files. For example, a log search alert can notify you when a web server returns a particular number of 404 or 500 responses.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="composition-of-an-alert-rule">Composition of an alert rule<a class="headerlink" href="#composition-of-an-alert-rule" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Every alert or notification available in Azure Monitor is the product of a rule. Some of these rules are built into the Azure platform. You can use alert rules to create custom alerts and notifications. No matter which target resource or data source you use, the composition of an alert rule remains the same.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RESOURCE</strong><ul>
<li>The <em>target resource</em> for the alert rule. You can assign multiple target resources to a single alert rule. The type of resource defines the available signal types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CONDITION</strong><ul>
<li>The <em>signal type</em> used to assess the rule. The signal type can be a metric, an activity log, or logs. There are others, but this module doesn't cover them.</li>
<li>The <em>alert logic</em> applied to the data that's being supplied via the signal type. The structure of the alert logic changes depending on the signal type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ACTIONS</strong><ul>
<li>The <em>action</em>, like sending an email, sending a Short Message Service (SMS) message, or using a webhook.</li>
<li>An <em>action group</em>, which typically contains a unique set of recipients for the action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ALERT DETAILS</strong><ul>
<li>An <em>alert name</em> and an <em>alert description</em> that specify the alert's purpose.</li>
<li>The <em>severity</em> of the alert if the criteria or logic test evaluates <code>true</code>. The five severity levels are:<ul>
<li><strong>0</strong>: Critical</li>
<li><strong>1</strong>: Error</li>
<li><strong>2</strong>: Warning</li>
<li><strong>3</strong>: Informational</li>
<li><strong>4</strong>: Verbose</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="scope-of-alert-rules">Scope of alert rules<a class="headerlink" href="#scope-of-alert-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You can get monitoring data from across most of the Azure services and report on it by using the Azure Monitor pipeline. In the Azure Monitor pipeline, you can create alert rules for these items and more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metric values</li>
<li>Log search queries</li>
<li>Activity log events</li>
<li>Health of the underlying Azure platform</li>
<li>Tests for website availability</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="manage-alert-rules">Manage alert rules<a class="headerlink" href="#manage-alert-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Not every alert rule that you create needs to run forever. With Azure Monitor, you can specify one or more alert rules and enable or disable them, as needed.</p>
<p>As an Azure solution architect, you want to use Azure Monitor to enable tightly focused and specific alerts before any application change. Then, disable the alerts after a successful deployment.</p>
<h2 id="alert-summary-view">Alert summary view<a class="headerlink" href="#alert-summary-view" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The alert page shows a summary of all alerts. You can apply filters to the view by using one or more of the following categories: subscriptions, alert condition, severity, or time ranges. The view includes only alerts that match these criteria.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Azure Monitor alerts page in the Azure Monitor portal." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/incident-response-with-alerting-on-azure/media/2-alerts-page.png" /></p>
<h3 id="alert-condition">Alert condition<a class="headerlink" href="#alert-condition" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The system sets the alert condition.</p>
<ul>
<li>When an alert fires, the alert's monitor condition is set to <strong>Fired</strong>.</li>
<li>After the underlying condition that caused the alert to fire clears, the monitor condition is set to <strong>Resolved</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="use-metric-alerts-for-alerts-about-performance-issues-in-your-azure-environment">Use metric alerts for alerts about performance issues in your Azure environment<a class="headerlink" href="#use-metric-alerts-for-alerts-about-performance-issues-in-your-azure-environment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Azure Monitor can use thresholds to monitor specific resources. In an organization, it's far more useful to be notified when the free disk space on a server is less than five percent, instead of being alerted every time a file is saved.</p>
<p>As a solution architect, you want to implement regular threshold monitoring for many of your target resources and instances. Monitoring helps to head off potential issues before they can affect your customers.</p>
<p>In this unit, you investigate the different kinds of metric alerts that Azure Monitor supports.</p>
<h2 id="when-would-you-use-metric-alerts">When would you use metric alerts?<a class="headerlink" href="#when-would-you-use-metric-alerts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In Azure Monitor, you can use metric alerts to achieve regular threshold monitoring of Azure resources. Azure Monitor runs metric alert trigger conditions at regular intervals. When the evaluation is true, Azure Monitor sends a notification. Metric alerts are stateful, and Azure Monitor sends a notification only when the prerequisite conditions are met.</p>
<p>Metric alerts can be useful if, for instance, you need to know when your server CPU utilization is reaching a critical threshold of 90 percent. You can receive alerts when your database storage is getting too low, or when network latency is about to reach unacceptable levels.</p>
<h2 id="composition-of-a-metric-alert">Composition of a metric alert<a class="headerlink" href="#composition-of-a-metric-alert" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As you learned in the previous unit, all alerts are the product of the rules that govern them. For metric alerts, there's another factor to define: the condition type. It can be static or dynamic.</p>
<p>You must define the type of statistical analysis to be used with either static or dynamic metric alerts. Example types are minimum, maximum, average, and total. In this example, you define the period of data to be assessed: the last 10 minutes. Finally, you set the frequency by which the alert conditions are checked: every two minutes.</p>
<h3 id="use-static-threshold-metric-alerts">Use static threshold metric alerts<a class="headerlink" href="#use-static-threshold-metric-alerts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Static metric alerts are based on simple static conditions and thresholds that you define. With static metrics, you specify the threshold used to trigger the alert or notification.</p>
<p>In the previously defined scenario, a static alert with a threshold of 85 percent CPU utilization checks the rule every two minutes. It evaluates the last 10 minutes of CPU utilization data to assess if it rises above the threshold. If the evaluation is true, the alert triggers the actions associated with the action group.</p>
<h3 id="use-dynamic-threshold-metric-alerts">Use dynamic threshold metric alerts<a class="headerlink" href="#use-dynamic-threshold-metric-alerts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Dynamic metric alerts use machine-learning tools that Azure provides to automatically improve the accuracy of the thresholds defined by the initial rule.</p>
<p>There's no hard threshold in dynamic metrics. However, you need to define two more parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>look-back period</em> defines how many previous periods need to be evaluated. For example, if you set the look-back period to three, then in the example used here, the assessed data range would be 30 minutes (three sets of 10 minutes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>number of violations</em> expresses how many times the logic condition has to deviate from the expected behavior before the alert rule fires a notification. In this example, if you set the number of violations to two, the alert would be triggered after two deviations from the calculated threshold.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understand-dimensions">Understand dimensions<a class="headerlink" href="#understand-dimensions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Until now, the assessed metric alerts we discussed, focused on a single target instance. Azure Monitor supports dimensions, which enable monitoring data to be supplied from multiple target instances.</p>
<p>You can use dimensions to define one metric alert rule and apply it to multiple related instances. For example, you can monitor CPU utilization across all the servers running your app. You can then receive an individual notification for each server instance when the rule conditions are triggered.</p>
<p>You can define the dimensions by naming each target instance specifically, or you can define the dimensions by using the asterisk (*) wildcard, which uses all available instances.</p>
<h2 id="scale-metric-alerts">Scale metric alerts<a class="headerlink" href="#scale-metric-alerts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Azure Monitor supports creating metric alerts that, like dimensions, monitor multiple resources. Scaling is currently limited to Azure virtual machines. However, a single metric alert can monitor resources in one Azure region.</p>
<p>Creating scaling metric alert rules to monitor multiple resources is no different than creating any other metric alert rule; you just select all the resources that you want to monitor.</p>
<p>Like dimensions, a scaling metric alert is individual to the resource that triggered it.</p>
<h1 id="exercise-use-metric-alerts-to-alert-on-performance-issues-in-your-azure-environment">Exercise - Use metric alerts to alert on performance issues in your Azure environment<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-use-metric-alerts-to-alert-on-performance-issues-in-your-azure-environment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The shipping company you work for wants to avoid any future issues with updates to its applications on the Azure platform. To improve the alert capabilities in Azure, you made the choice to use Azure metric alerts.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you create a Linux virtual machine (VM). This VM runs an app that runs the CPU at 100 percent utilization. You create monitoring rules in the Azure portal and in the Azure CLI to alert you about high CPU usage.</p>

<p>This VM runs a specific configuration that stresses the CPU and generates the metric monitoring data needed to trigger an alert.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start by creating the configuration script. To create the <code>cloud-init.txt</code> file with the configuration for the VM, run the following command in Azure Cloud Shell:</p>
<p>BashCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; cloud-init.txt

</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>To set up an Ubuntu Linux VM, run the following <code>az vm create</code> command. This command uses the <code>cloud-init.txt</code> file that you created in the previous step to configure the newly created Ubuntu Linux VM.</p>

<h1 id="use-log-search-alerts-to-alert-on-events-in-your-application">Use log search alerts to alert on events in your application<a class="headerlink" href="#use-log-search-alerts-to-alert-on-events-in-your-application" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>You can use Azure Monitor to capture important information from log files. Applications, operating systems, other hardware, or Azure services can create these log files.</p>
<p>As a solution architect, you want to explore ways that monitoring log data can detect issues before they become issues for your customers. You know that Azure Monitor supports the use of log data.</p>
<p>In this unit, you understand how using log data can improve resilience in your system.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-log-search-alerts">When to use log search alerts<a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-use-log-search-alerts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Log search alerts use log data to assess the rule logic and, if necessary, trigger an alert. This data can come from any Azure resource: server logs, application server logs, or application logs.</p>
<p>By its nature, log data is historical, so usage is focused on analytics and trends.</p>
<p>You can use these types of logs to assess if any of your servers exceeded their CPU utilization by a given threshold during the last 30 minutes. Or, you could evaluate response codes issued on your web application server in the last hour.</p>
<h2 id="how-log-search-alerts-work">How log search alerts work<a class="headerlink" href="#how-log-search-alerts-work" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Log search alerts behave in a slightly different way than other alert mechanisms. The first part of a log search alert defines the log search rule. The rule defines how often it should run, the time period under evaluation, and the query to be run.</p>
<p>When a log search evaluates as positive, it creates an alert record and triggers any associated actions.</p>
<h2 id="composition-of-log-search-rules">Composition of log search rules<a class="headerlink" href="#composition-of-log-search-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Every log search alert has an associated search rule with the following composition:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log query</strong>: Query that runs every time the alert rule fires.</li>
<li><strong>Time period</strong>: Time range for the query.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: How often the query should run.</li>
<li><strong>Threshold</strong>: Trigger point for an alert to be created.</li>
</ul>
<p>Log search results are one of two types: <em>number of records</em> or <em>metric measurement</em>.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-records">Number of records<a class="headerlink" href="#number-of-records" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Consider using the number-of-records type of log search when you're working with an event or event-driven data. Examples are syslog and web-app responses.</p>
<p>This type of log search returns a single alert when the number of records in a search result reaches or exceeds the value for the number of records (threshold). For example, when the threshold for the search rule is greater or equal to five, the query results have to return five or more rows of data before the alert is triggered.</p>
<h3 id="metric-measurement">Metric measurement<a class="headerlink" href="#metric-measurement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Metric measurement logs offer the same basic functionality as metric alert logs.</p>
<p>Unlike number-of-records search logs, metric measurement logs require further criteria to be set:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aggregate function</strong>: The calculation to be made against the result data. An example is count or average. The result of the function is called <strong>AggregatedValue</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Group field</strong>: Indicates how the result should be grouped. This criterion is used with the aggregated value. For example, you might specify that you want the average grouped by computer.</li>
<li><strong>Interval</strong>: The time interval by which data is aggregated. For example, if you specify 10 minutes, an alert record is created for each aggregated block of 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Threshold</strong>: A point defined by an aggregated value and the total number of breaches.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider using this type of alert when you need to add a level of tolerance to the results found. One use for this type of alert is to respond if a particular trend or pattern is found. For example, if the number of breaches is five, and any server in your group exceeds 85 percent CPU utilization more than five times within the given time period, an alert fires.</p>
<p>As you can see, metric measurements greatly reduce the volume of alerts that are produced. Still, give careful consideration when you're setting the threshold parameters to avoid missing critical alerts.</p>
<h2 id="stateless-nature-of-log-search-alerts">Stateless nature of log search alerts<a class="headerlink" href="#stateless-nature-of-log-search-alerts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>One of the primary considerations when you're evaluating the use of log search alerts is that they're stateless (stateful log search alerts are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-types#log-alerts">currently in preview</a>). A stateless log search alert generates new alerts every time the rule criteria are triggered, regardless of whether the alert was previously recorded.</p>
<h1 id="use-activity-log-alerts-to-alert-on-events-within-your-azure-infrastructure">Use activity log alerts to alert on events within your Azure infrastructure<a class="headerlink" href="#use-activity-log-alerts-to-alert-on-events-within-your-azure-infrastructure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Activity log alerts allow you to be notified when a specific event happens on some Azure resource. For example, you can be notified when someone creates a new virtual machine (VM) in a subscription.</p>
<p>An activity log can also include alerts for Azure service health. A company can get notifications when service issues or planned maintenance happens on the Azure platform.</p>
<p>As an Azure solution architect, you want to explore the capability to monitor selected Azure resources within your subscription. You want to understand how you can use the resources to improve your team's responsiveness and the stability of your systems.</p>
<p>In this unit, you explore the two different kinds of activity log alerts. Now that you're aware of the different kinds of alerts you can use in Azure Monitor, you want to know how you can trigger actions for your alerts. Actions might include sending an email or creating an IT Service Management (ITSM) support ticket.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-activity-log-alerts">When to use activity log alerts<a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-use-activity-log-alerts" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>So far, you learned about two different types of alerts supported in Azure Monitor. <em>Metric alerts</em> are ideally suited to monitoring for threshold breaches or spotting trends; <em>Log search alerts</em> allow for greater analytical monitoring of historical data.</p>
<p><em>Activity log alerts</em> are designed to work with Azure resources. Typically, you create this type of log to receive notifications when specific changes occur on a resource within your Azure subscription.</p>
<p>There are two types of activity log alerts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific operations</strong>: Applies to resources within your Azure subscription, and often has a scope with specific resources or a resource group. You use this type when you need to receive an alert that reports a change to an aspect of your subscription. For example, you can receive an alert if a VM is deleted or new roles are assigned to a user.</li>
<li><strong>Service health events</strong>: Include notice of incidents and maintenance of target resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="composition-of-an-activity-log-alert">Composition of an activity log alert<a class="headerlink" href="#composition-of-an-activity-log-alert" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>It's important to note that activity log alerts monitor events only in the subscription where the alert was created.</p>
<p>Activity log alerts are based on events. The best approach for defining them is to use Azure Monitor to filter all the events in your subscription until you find the one that you want. To begin the creation process, you then select <strong>Add activity log alert</strong>.</p>
<p>Like the previous alerts, activity log alerts have their own attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Category</strong>: Administrative, service health, autoscale, policy, or recommendation</li>
<li><strong>Scope</strong>: Resource level, resource group level, or subscription level</li>
<li><strong>Resource group</strong>: Where the alert rule is saved</li>
<li><strong>Resource type</strong>: Namespace for the target of the alert</li>
<li><strong>Operation name</strong>: Operation name</li>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: Verbose, informational, warning, error, or critical</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: Started, failed, or succeeded</li>
<li><strong>Event initiated by</strong>: Email address or Microsoft Entra identifier (known as the "caller") for the user</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="create-a-resource-specific-log-alert">Create a resource-specific log alert<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-resource-specific-log-alert" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>When you create your activity log alert, you select <strong>Activity Log</strong> for the signal type. You then see all the available alerts for the resource you select. The following image shows all the administrative alerts for Azure VMs. In this example, an alert is triggered when a VM is powered off.</p>
<p>Changing the monitor service enables you to reduce the list of options. Selecting <strong>Administrative</strong> filters all the signals to show only admin-related signals.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the signal logic for activity log alerts related to VMs." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/incident-response-with-alerting-on-azure/media/6-example-activity-log-alert.png" /></p>
<h3 id="create-a-service-health-alert">Create a service health alert<a class="headerlink" href="#create-a-service-health-alert" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Service health alerts aren't like all the other alert types you learned about in this module so far. To create a new alert, search for and select <strong>Service Health</strong> in the Azure portal. Next, select <strong>Health alerts</strong>. After you select <strong>Create service health alert</strong>, the steps to create the alert are similar to the steps used to create other alerts.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot that shows how to create a new service health alert." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/incident-response-with-alerting-on-azure/media/6-service-health-alerts.png" /></p>
<p>The only difference is that you no longer need to select a resource, because the alert is for a whole region in Azure. What you can select is the kind of health event on which you want to be alerted. You can select service issues, planned maintenance, health advisories, or choose all of the events. The remaining steps of performing actions and naming the alerts are the same.</p>
<h1 id="use-action-groups-and-alert-processing-rules-to-send-notifications-when-an-alert-is-fired">Use action groups and alert processing rules to send notifications when an alert is fired<a class="headerlink" href="#use-action-groups-and-alert-processing-rules-to-send-notifications-when-an-alert-is-fired" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Azure Monitor, Azure Service Health, and Azure Advisor use <em>action groups</em> to notify users about the alert, and to take an action when an alert is fired. An action group is a collection of notification preferences and actions that are executed when the alert is fired. You can run one or more actions for each triggered alert.</p>
<p>Azure Monitor can perform any of the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send an email</li>
<li>Send a Short Message Service (SMS) message</li>
<li>Create an Azure app push notification</li>
<li>Make a voice call to a number</li>
<li>Call an Azure function</li>
<li>Trigger a logic app</li>
<li>Send a notification to a webhook</li>
<li>Create an IT Service Management (ITSM) ticket</li>
<li>Use a runbook (to restart a virtual machine (VM) or scale a VM up or down)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you create an action group, you can reuse that action group as often as you want. For example, after you create an action to email your company's operations team, you can add that action group to all service-health events.</p>
<p>While you're creating the alert rule, you can either create a new action group or add an existing action group to the alert rule. You can also edit an existing alert to add an action group.</p>
<h2 id="alert-processing-rules">Alert processing rules<a class="headerlink" href="#alert-processing-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Use alert processing rules to override the normal behavior of a fired alert by adding or suppressing an action group. You can use alert processing rules to add action groups or remove (suppress) action groups from your fired alerts. Alert processing rules are different from alert rules. Alert rules trigger alerts when a condition is met in your monitored resources. Alert processing rules modify the alerts as they're being fired.</p>
<p>You can use alert processing rules to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppress notifications during planned maintenance windows.</li>
<li>Implement management at scale, by specifying commonly used logic in a single rule, instead of having to set it consistently in all your alert rules.</li>
<li>Add an action group to all alert types.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply alert processing rules to different resource scopes, from a single resource, or to an entire subscription. You can also use them to apply various filters or have the rule work on a predefined schedule.</p>
<p>You can control when the alert processing rule applies. By default the rule is always active. But, you can select a one-time window for this rule to apply, or you can set a recurrence such as a weekly recurrence.</p>

<h1 id="introduction_5">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction_5" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Logging and monitoring the health of your services is a vital component of production applications. You need to be able to determine the causes of failures. You also need to identify any problems before they occur.</p>
<p>Azure Monitor is an important tool to help you in this process. It allows you to gather monitoring and diagnostic information about the health of your services. You can use this information to visualize and analyze the causes of problems that might occur in your app.</p>
<p>Suppose that you work for a large organization's operations team. The organization is running large-scale production apps in the cloud. The team wants to consolidate its log data in a single service to improve visibility across services and simplify its logging strategy.</p>
<p>The team began implementing Azure Monitor logs. It wants to fully understand how the logs work. It also wants to know the service's capabilities to query and evaluate the log data that's fed into it.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives_3">Learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-objectives_3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In this module, you'll:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the features and capabilities of Azure Monitor logs.</li>
<li>Create basic Azure Monitor log queries to extract information from log data.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="features-of-azure-monitor-logs">Features of Azure Monitor logs<a class="headerlink" href="#features-of-azure-monitor-logs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Azure Monitor is a service for collecting and analyzing telemetry. It helps you get maximum performance and availability for your cloud applications and for your on-premises resources and applications. It shows how your applications are performing and identifies any issues with them.</p>
<h2 id="data-collection-in-azure-monitor">Data collection in Azure Monitor<a class="headerlink" href="#data-collection-in-azure-monitor" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Azure Monitor collects two fundamental types of data: metrics and logs. Metrics tell you how a resource is performing and the other resources that it's consuming. Logs contain records that show when resources are created or modified.</p>
<p>The following diagram gives a high-level view of Azure Monitor. On the left are the data-monitoring sources: Azure, operating systems, and custom sources. At the center of the diagram are the data stores for metrics and logs. On the right are the functions that Azure Monitor performs with this collected data, such as analysis, alerting, and streaming to external systems.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram of Azure Monitor's architecture, displaying the sources of monitoring data, the data stores, and functions performed on the data." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-infrastructure-with-azure-monitor-logs/media/2-azure-monitor.svg" /></p>
<p>Azure Monitor collects data automatically from a range of components. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Application data</strong>: Data that relates to your custom application code.</li>
<li><strong>Operating-system data</strong>: Data from the Windows or Linux virtual machines that host your application.</li>
<li><strong>Azure resource data</strong>: Data that relates to the operations of an Azure resource, such as a web app or a load balancer.</li>
<li><strong>Azure subscription data</strong>: Data that relates to your subscription, including data about Azure health and availability.</li>
<li><strong>Azure tenant data</strong>: Data about your Azure organization-level services, such as Microsoft Entra ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Azure Monitor is an automatic system, it begins to collect data from these sources as soon as you create Azure resources like virtual machines and web apps. You can extend the data that Azure Monitor collects by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enabling diagnostics</strong>: For some resources, such as Azure SQL Databases, you'll receive full information about a resource only after you've enabled diagnostic logging for it. You can use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, or PowerShell to enable diagnostics.</li>
<li><strong>Adding an agent</strong>: For virtual machines, you can install the Log Analytics agent and configure it to send data to a Log Analytics workspace. This agent increases the amount of information that's sent to Azure Monitor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your developers might also want to send data to Azure Monitor from custom code such as a web app, an Azure function, or a mobile app. They send data by calling the Data Collector API. You can communicate with this REST interface through HTTP. This interface is compatible with various development frameworks such as .NET Framework, Node.js, and Python. Developers can choose their favorite language and framework to log data in Azure Monitor.</p>
<h3 id="logs">Logs<a class="headerlink" href="#logs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Logs contain time-stamped information about resource changes. The type of information recorded varies by log source. The log data is organized into records, with different sets of properties for each type of record. The logs can include numeric values like Azure Monitor metrics, but most include text data rather than numeric values.</p>
<p>The most common type of log entry records an event. Events can occur sporadically rather than at fixed intervals or according to a schedule. Applications and services create events and provide the event context. You can store metric data in logs to combine them with other monitoring data for analysis.</p>
<p>You can log data from Azure Monitor in a Log Analytics workspace. Azure provides an analysis engine and a rich query language. The logs show the context of any problems, and they're useful for identifying root causes.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of an example query against Azure logs with the query text on top and a graph displaying the results below." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-infrastructure-with-azure-monitor-logs/media/2-azure-logs-query-example.png" /></p>
<h3 id="metrics">Metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#metrics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Metrics are numerical values that describe some aspect of a system at a point in time. Azure Monitor can capture metrics in near-real time. The metrics are collected at regular intervals, and they're useful for alerting because of their frequent sampling. You can use various algorithms to compare a metric to other metrics and observe trends over time.</p>
<p>Metrics are stored in a time-series database. This data store is most effective for analyzing time-stamped data. Metrics are suited for alerting and fast detection of issues. They can tell you about system performance. If needed, you can combine them with logs to identify the root cause of issues.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of an example chart in Azure Metrics displaying average CPU percentage." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-infrastructure-with-azure-monitor-logs/media/2-azure-monitor-metrics.png" /></p>
<h2 id="analyzing-logs-by-using-kusto">Analyzing logs by using Kusto<a class="headerlink" href="#analyzing-logs-by-using-kusto" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>To retrieve, consolidate, and analyze data, you can specify a query to run in Azure Monitor logs. You can write a log query with the Kusto query language, which Azure Data Explorer also uses.</p>
<p>You can test log queries in the Azure portal so you can work with them interactively. You'll typically start with basic queries, then progress to more advanced functions as your requirements become more complex.</p>
<p>In the Azure portal, you can create custom dashboards, which are targeted displays of resources and data. You can build each dashboard from a set of tiles. Each tile might show a set of resources, a chart, a data table, or some custom text. Azure Monitor provides tiles that you can add to dashboards; for example, you might use a tile to display a Kusto query's results in a dashboard.</p>
<p>In the example scenario, the operations team can consolidate its monitoring data by visualizing it in charts and tables. These tools are effective for summarizing data and presenting it to different audiences.</p>
<p>By using Azure dashboards, you can combine various kinds of data—including both logs and metrics—into a single pane in the Azure portal. For example, you might want to create a dashboard that combines tiles that show a graph of metrics, a table of activity logs, charts from Azure Monitor, and a log query's output.</p>

<p>You can use Azure Monitor log queries to extract information from log data. Querying is an important part of examining the log data that Azure Monitor captures.</p>
<p>In the example scenario, the operations team uses Azure Monitor log queries to examine the health of its system.</p>

<p>You can find the Log Analytics tool in the Azure portal and use it to run sample queries or to create your own queries:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Azure portal, in the left menu pane, select <strong>Monitor</strong>.</p>
<p>The Azure Monitor page appears along with more options, including <strong>Activity Log</strong>, <strong>Alerts</strong>, <strong>Metrics</strong>, and <strong>Logs</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Logs</strong>.</p>
<p>Here, you can enter your query and see the output.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Azure Monitor with a new query tab opened." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-infrastructure-with-azure-monitor-logs/media/3-azure-monitor-portal-query-pane.png" /></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="write-queries-by-using-the-kusto-language">Write queries by using the Kusto language<a class="headerlink" href="#write-queries-by-using-the-kusto-language" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You can use the Kusto Query Language to query log information for your services running in Azure. A Kusto query is a read-only request to process data and return results. You'll state the query in plain text by using a data-flow model that's designed to make the syntax easy to read, write, and automate. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to that of Azure SQL Database: databases, tables, and columns.</p>
<p>A Kusto query consists of a sequence of query statements delimited by a semicolon (<code>;</code>). At least one statement is a tabular expression statement. A tabular expression statement formats the data arranged as a table of columns and rows.</p>
<p>A tabular expression statement's syntax has a tabular data flow from one tabular query operator to another, starting with a data source. A data source might be a table in a database or an operator that produces data. The data then flows through a set of data-transformation operators that are bound together with the pipe (<code>|</code>) delimiter.</p>
<p>For example, the following Kusto query has a single tabular expression statement. The statement starts with a reference to a table called <code>Events</code>. The database that hosts this table is implicit here, and is part of the connection information. The data for that table, stored in rows, is filtered by the value of the <code>StartTime</code> column. The data is filtered further by the value of the <code>State</code> column. The query then returns the count of the resulting rows.</p>
<p>KustoCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Events
| where StartTime &gt;= datetime(2018-11-01) and StartTime &lt; datetime(2018-12-01)
| where State == &quot;FLORIDA&quot;  
| count
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The Kusto query language that Azure Monitor uses is case-sensitive. Language keywords are typically written in lowercase. When you're using names of tables or columns in a query, make sure to use the correct case.</p>
<p>Events captured from the event logs of monitored computers are just one type of data source. Azure Monitor provides many other types of data sources. For example, the <code>Heartbeat</code> data source reports the health of all computers that report to your Log Analytics workspace. You can also capture data from performance counters and update management records.</p>
<p>The following example retrieves the most recent heartbeat record for each computer. The computer is identified by its IP address. In this example, the <code>summarize</code> aggregation with the <code>arg_max</code> function returns the record with the most recent value for each IP address.</p>
<p>KustoCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Heartbeat
| summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by ComputerIP
</code></pre></div>
<h1 id="exercise-create-basic-azure-monitor-log-queries-to-extract-information-from-log-data">Exercise - Create basic Azure Monitor log queries to extract information from log data<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-create-basic-azure-monitor-log-queries-to-extract-information-from-log-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The operations team doesn't currently have enough information about its system behavior to diagnose and resolve problems effectively. To address this issue, the team has configured an Azure Monitor workspace with the company's Azure services. It runs Kusto queries to get the system's status and attempts to identify the causes of any problems that might occur.</p>
<p>In particular, the team is interested in monitoring security events to check for possible attempts to break into the system. An attacker might try to manipulate the applications running on the system, so the team also wants to gather application data for further analysis. An attacker might also try to halt the computers that compose the system, so the team wants to examine how and when machines are stopped and restarted.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you'll practice performing Azure log queries against a demo project that contains sample data in tables, logs, and queries.</p>
<h2 id="create-basic-azure-monitor-log-queries-to-extract-information-from-log-data_1">Create basic Azure Monitor log queries to extract information from log data<a class="headerlink" href="#create-basic-azure-monitor-log-queries-to-extract-information-from-log-data_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Let's use the <strong>Azure Demo Logs pane</strong> to practice writing queries. The demo project workspace is prepopulated with sample data. Azure offers an optimized SQL-like query with visualization options of its data in a language called KQL (Kusto Query Language.)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring_Logs/DemoLogsBlade?azure-portal=true">Logs demo environment</a>. In the top-left corner, under <strong>New Query 1</strong>, you'll find <strong>Demo</strong>, which identifies the query's workspace (or scope). The left side of this pane contains several tabs: <strong>Tables</strong>, <strong>Queries</strong>, and <strong>Functions</strong>. The right side has a scratchpad for creating or editing queries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <strong>New Query 1</strong> tab, enter a basic query on the first line of the scratchpad. This query retrieves the details of the 10 most recent security events.</p>
<p>KustoCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SecurityEvent
    | take 10
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the command bar, select <strong>Run</strong> to execute the query and view the results. You can expand each row in the results pane for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sort the data by time by adding a filter to your query:</p>
<p>KustoCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SecurityEvent
    | top 10 by TimeGenerated
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a filter clause and a time range. Run this query to fetch records that are more than 30 minutes old and that have a level of 10 or more:</p>
<p>KustoCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>SecurityEvent
    | where TimeGenerated &lt; ago(30m)
    | where toint(Level) &gt;= 10
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following query to search the <code>AppEvents</code> table for records of the <code>Clicked Schedule Button</code> event being invoked in the last 24 hours:</p>
<p>KustoCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>AppEvents 
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(24h)
    | where Name == &quot;Clicked Schedule Button&quot;
</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following query to display the number of different computers that generated heartbeat events each week for the last three weeks. The results appear as a bar chart:</p>
<p>KustoCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>Heartbeat
    | where TimeGenerated &gt;= startofweek(ago(21d))
    | summarize dcount(Computer) by endofweek(TimeGenerated) | render barchart kind=default
</code></pre></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="use-predefined-azure-log-queries-to-extract-information-from-log-data">Use predefined Azure log queries to extract information from log data<a class="headerlink" href="#use-predefined-azure-log-queries-to-extract-information-from-log-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In addition to writing queries from scratch, the operations team can also take advantage of predefined queries in Azure Logs that answer common questions related to their resources' health, availability, usage, and performance.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Time Range</strong> parameter in the command bar to set a custom range. Select the month, year, and day to a range from January to today. You can set and apply a custom time to any query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the left toolbar, select <strong>Queries</strong>. In the drop-down list in the left menu, you can view a list of the sample queries grouped by <em>Category</em>, <em>Query type</em>, <em>Resource type</em>, <em>Solution</em>, or <em>Topic</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Group By dropdown options under Queries tab in side pane." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-infrastructure-with-azure-monitor-logs/media/4-azure-queries-category-groupby.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Category</strong> in the drop-down list, then select <strong>IT &amp; Management Tools</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the search box, enter <em>Distinct missing updates cross computers</em>. Double-click the query in the left pane, then select <strong>Run</strong>. The <strong>Logs</strong> pane reappears, with the query returning a list of Windows updates missing from virtual machines that are sending logs to the workspace.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You can also run this same query from the <strong>Logs</strong> pane. In the left pane, select the <strong>Queries</strong> tab, then select <strong>Category</strong> in the <strong>Group by</strong> dropdown list. Now scroll down the list, expand <strong>IT &amp; Management Tools</strong>, and double-click <strong>Distinct missing updates cross computers</strong>. Select <strong>Run</strong> to run the query. When you select a predefined query in the left pane, the query code is appended to whatever query exists in the scratchpad. Remember to clear the scratchpad before opening or adding a new query to run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the left pane, clear the search box. Select <strong>Queries</strong>, then select <strong>Category</strong> in the <strong>Group by</strong> dropdown list. Expand <strong>Azure Monitor</strong> and double-click <strong>Computers availability today</strong>. Select <strong>Run</strong>. This query creates a time series chart with the number of unique IP addresses sending logs into the workspace each hour for the last day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select <strong>Topic</strong> in the <strong>Group by</strong> dropdown list, scroll down to expand <strong>Function App</strong>, and then double-click <strong>Show application logs from Function Apps</strong>. Select <strong>Run</strong>. This query returns a list of application logs, sorted by time with the latest logs shown first.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll notice that from the Kusto queries you used here, it's easy to target a query to a specific time window, event level, or event log type. The security team can easily examine heartbeats to identify when servers are unavailable, which might indicate a denial-of-service attack. If the team spots the time when a server was unavailable, it can query for events in the security log around that time to diagnose whether an attack caused the interruption. Additionally, predefined queries can also evaluate VM availability, identify missing Windows updates, and review firewall logs to view denied network flows intended for the VMs of interest.</p>

<h1 id="monitoring-for-azure-vms">Monitoring for Azure VMs<a class="headerlink" href="#monitoring-for-azure-vms" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>In this unit, you explore Azure monitoring capabilities for VMs, and the types of monitoring data you can collect and analyze with Azure Monitor. Azure Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring solution for collecting, analyzing, and responding to monitoring data from Azure and non-Azure resources, including VMs. Azure Monitor has two main monitoring features: Azure Monitor Metrics and Azure Monitor Logs.</p>
<p>Metrics are numerical values collected at predetermined intervals to describe some aspect of a system. Metrics can measure VM performance, resource utilization, error counts, user responses, or any other aspect of the system that you can quantify. Azure Monitor Metrics automatically monitors a predefined set of metrics for every Azure VM, and retains the data for 93 days with some exceptions.</p>
<p>Logs are recorded system events that contain a timestamp and different types of structured or free-form data. Azure automatically records activity logs for all Azure resources. This data is available at the resource level. Azure Monitor doesn't collect logs by default, but you can configure Azure Monitor Logs to collect from any Azure resource. Azure Monitor Logs stores log data in a Log Analytics workspace for querying and analysis.</p>
<h2 id="vm-monitoring-layers">VM monitoring layers<a class="headerlink" href="#vm-monitoring-layers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Azure VMs have several layers that require monitoring. Each of the following layers has a distinct set of telemetry and monitoring requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>Host VM</li>
<li>Guest operating system (OS)</li>
<li>Client workloads</li>
<li>Applications that run on the VM</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Diagram that shows fundamental VM architecture." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-azure-vm-using-diagnostic-data/media/monitoring-layers.png" /></p>
<h2 id="host-vm-monitoring">Host VM monitoring<a class="headerlink" href="#host-vm-monitoring" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The VM host represents the compute, storage, and network resources that Azure allocates to the VM.</p>
<h3 id="vm-host-metrics">VM host metrics<a class="headerlink" href="#vm-host-metrics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>VM host metrics measure technical aspects of the VM such as processor utilization and whether the machine is running. You can use VM host metrics to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trigger an alert when your VM is reaching its disk or CPU limits.</li>
<li>Identify trends or patterns.</li>
<li>Control your operational costs by sizing VMs according to usage and demand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Azure automatically collects basic metrics for VM hosts. On the VM's <strong>Overview</strong> page in the Azure portal, you can see built-in graphs for the following important VM host metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>VM availability</li>
<li>CPU usage percentage (average)</li>
<li>OS disk usage (total)</li>
<li>Network operations (total)</li>
<li>Disk operations per second (average)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer to plot more metrics graphs, investigate changes, and visually correlate metrics trends for your VMs. With Metrics Explorer you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plot multiple metrics on a graph to see how much traffic hits your VM and how the VM performs.</li>
<li>Track the same metric over multiple VMs in a resource group or other scope, and use splitting to show each VM on the graph.</li>
<li>Select flexible time ranges and granularity.</li>
<li>Specify many other settings such as chart type and value ranges.</li>
<li>Send graphs to workbooks or pin them to dashboards for quickly viewing health and performance.</li>
<li>Group metrics by time intervals, geographic regions, server clusters, or application components.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-azure-vm-using-diagnostic-data/media/2-vm-metrics-screenshot.png#lightbox"><img alt="Screenshot showing CPU percentage usage and inbound flow chart." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-azure-vm-using-diagnostic-data/media/2-vm-metrics-screenshot.png" /></a></p>
<h3 id="recommended-alert-rules">Recommended alert rules<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-alert-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Alerts proactively notify you of specified occurrences and patterns in your VM host metrics. <em>Recommended alert rules</em> are a predefined set of alert rules based on commonly monitored host metrics. These rules define recommended CPU, memory, disk, and network usage levels to alert on. The rules also include VM availability, which alerts you when the VM stops running.</p>
<p>You can quickly enable and configure recommended alert rules when you create an Azure VM, or afterwards from the VM's portal page. You can also view, configure, and create custom alerts by using Azure Monitor Alerts.</p>
<h3 id="activity-logs">Activity logs<a class="headerlink" href="#activity-logs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Monitor automatically records and displays activity logs for Azure VMs. Activity logs include information like VM startup or modifications. You can create diagnostic settings to send activity logs to the following destinations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure Monitor Logs:</strong> For more complex querying and alerting, and for longer retention up to two years.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Storage:</strong> For cheaper, long-term archiving.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Event Hubs:</strong> To forward outside of Azure.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="boot-diagnostics">Boot diagnostics<a class="headerlink" href="#boot-diagnostics" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Boot diagnostics are host logs you can use to help troubleshoot boot issues with your VMs. You can enable boot diagnostics by default when you create a VM, or afterwards for existing VMs.</p>
<p>Once you enable boot diagnostics, you can see screenshots from the VM's hypervisor for both Windows and Linux machines, and view the serial console log output of the VM boot sequence for Linux machines. Boot diagnostics stores data in a managed storage account.</p>
<h2 id="guest-os-client-workload-and-application-monitoring">Guest OS, client workload, and application monitoring<a class="headerlink" href="#guest-os-client-workload-and-application-monitoring" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>VM client monitoring can include monitoring the operating system (OS), workloads, and applications that run on the VM. To collect metrics and logs from guest OS and client workloads and applications, you need to install Azure Monitor Agent and set up a DCR.</p>
<p>DCRs define what data to collect and where to send that data. You can use a DCR to send Azure Monitor metrics data, or <em>performance counters</em>, to Azure Monitor Logs or Azure Monitor Metrics. You can also send event log data to Azure Monitor Logs. In other words, Azure Monitor Metrics can store only metrics data, but Azure Monitor Logs can store both metrics and event logs.</p>
<h3 id="vm-insights">VM insights<a class="headerlink" href="#vm-insights" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>VM insights is an Azure Monitor feature that helps get you started monitoring your VM clients. VM insights is especially useful for exploring overall VM usage and performance when you don't yet know the metric of primary interest. VM insights provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified Azure Monitor Agent onboarding to enable monitoring a VM's guest OS and workloads.</li>
<li>A preconfigured DCR that monitors and collects the most common performance counters for Windows and Linux.</li>
<li>Predefined trending performance metrics charts and workbooks from the VM's guest OS.</li>
<li>A set of predefined workbooks that show collected VM client metrics over time.</li>
<li>Optionally, a collection of processes running on the VM, dependencies with other services, and a dependency map that displays interconnected components with other VMs and external sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Predefined VM insights workbooks show performance, connections, active ports, traffic, and other collected data from one or several VMs. You can view VM insights data directly from a single VM, or see a combined view of multiple VMs to view and assess trends and patterns across VMs. You can edit the prebuilt workbook configurations, or create your own custom workbooks.</p>
<h3 id="client-event-log-data">Client event log data<a class="headerlink" href="#client-event-log-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>VM insights creates a DCR that collects a specific set of performance counters. To collect other data, such as event logs, you can create a separate DCR that specifies the data you want to collect from the VM and where to send it. Azure Monitor stores collected log data in a Log Analytics workspace. From there, you can access and analyze the data by using log queries written in Kusto Query Language (KQL).</p>
<h1 id="monitor-vm-host-data">Monitor VM host data<a class="headerlink" href="#monitor-vm-host-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>You want to monitor the VMs that host your website, so you decide to quickly create a VM in the Azure portal and evaluate its built-in monitoring capabilities. In this unit, you use the Azure portal to create a Linux VM with recommended alerts and boot diagnostics enabled. As soon as the VM starts up, Azure automatically begins collecting basic metrics and activity logs. You can then view built-in metrics graphs, activity logs, and boot diagnostics.</p>

<p>Besides monitoring your VM host's health, utilization, and performance, you need to monitor the software and processes running on your VM. These are called the VM guest or client. In this unit, you enable the Azure Monitor VM insights feature, which offers a quick way to start monitoring the VM client.</p>
<p>The VM client includes the operating system and other workloads and applications. To monitor the software running on your VM, you install the Azure Monitor Agent, which collects data from inside the VM. VM insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installs Azure Monitor Agent on your VM.</li>
<li>Creates a DCR that collects and sends a predefined set of client performance data to a Log Analytics workspace.</li>
<li>Presents the data in curated workbooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although you don't need to use VM insights to install Azure Monitor Agent, create DCRs, or set up workbooks, VM insights makes setting up VM client monitoring easy. VM insights provides you with a basis for monitoring the performance of your VM client and mapping the processes running on your machine.</p>

<p>Azure Monitor Metrics and VM insights performance counters help you identify performance anomalies, and alert when thresholds are reached. But to analyze the root causes of issues you detect, you need to analyze log data to see which system events caused or contributed to the issues. In this unit, you set up a DCR to collect Linux VM Syslog data, and view the log data in Azure Monitor Log Analytics by using a simple Kusto Query Language (KQL) query.</p>
<p>VM insights installs the Azure Monitor Agent, and creates a DCR that collects predefined performance counters, maps process dependencies, and presents the data in prebuilt workbooks. You can create your own DCRs to collect VM performance counters that the VM insights DCR doesn't collect, or to collect log data.</p>
<p>When you create DCRs in the Azure portal, you can select from a range of performance counters and sampling rates or add custom performance counters. Alternatively, you can select from a predefined set of log types and severity levels or define custom log schemas. You can associate a single DCR to any or all VMs in your subscription, but you might need multiple DCRs to collect different types of data from different VMs.</p>

<p>You can view and analyze the log data collected by your DCR by using KQL log queries. A set of sample KQL queries is available for VMs, but you can write a query to look at the events your DCR is collecting.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On your VM's <strong>Overview</strong> page, select <strong>Logs</strong> from the left navigation menu under <strong>Monitoring</strong>. Log Analytics opens an empty query window with the scope set to your VM.</p>
<p>You can also access log data by selecting <strong>Logs</strong> from the left navigation of the Azure Monitor <strong>Overview</strong> page. If necessary, select <strong>Select scope</strong> at the top of the query window to scope the query to the desired Log Analytics workspace and VM.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The <strong>Queries</strong> window with sample queries might open when you open Log Analytics. For now, close this window, because you're going to manually create a simple query.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the empty query window, type <em>Syslog</em>, and then select <strong>Run</strong>. All the system log events the DCR collected within the <strong>Time range</strong> are displayed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can refine your query to identify events of interest. For example, you can display only the events that had a <strong>SeverityLevel</strong> of <strong>warning</strong>.</p>
