<p>Azure Storage is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data storage scenarios. Azure Storage offers a massively scalable object store for data objects. It provides a file system service for the cloud, a messaging store for reliable messaging, and a NoSQL store.</p>
<p>Azure Storage is a service that you can use to store files, messages, tables, and other types of information. You use Azure Storage for applications like file shares. Developers use Azure Storage for working data. Working data includes websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications. Azure Storage is also used by IaaS virtual machines, and PaaS cloud services.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-azure-storage">Things to know about Azure Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-azure-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>You can think of Azure Storage as supporting three categories of data: structured data, unstructured data, and virtual machine data. Review the following categories and think about which types of storage are used in your organization.</p>
<p>Expand table</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Category</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Storage examples</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Virtual machine data</strong></td>
<td>Virtual machine data storage includes disks and files. Disks are persistent block storage for Azure IaaS virtual machines. Files are fully managed file shares in the cloud.</td>
<td>Storage for virtual machine data is provided through Azure managed disks. Data disks are used by virtual machines to store data like database files, website static content, or custom application code. The number of data disks you can add depends on the virtual machine size. Each data disk has a maximum capacity of 32,767 GB.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Unstructured data</strong></td>
<td>Unstructured data is the least organized. Unstructured data may not have a clear relationship. The format of unstructured data is referred to as <em>nonrelational</em>.</td>
<td>Unstructured data can be stored by using Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage. Blob Storage is a highly scalable, REST-based cloud object store. Azure Data Lake Storage is the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as a service.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Structured data</strong></td>
<td>Structured data is stored in a relational format that has a shared schema. Structured data is often contained in a database table with rows, columns, and keys. Tables are an autoscaling NoSQL store.</td>
<td>Structured data can be stored by using Azure Table Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure SQL Database. Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed database service. Azure SQL Database is a fully managed database-as-a-service built on SQL.</td>

<h4 id="storage-account-types">Storage account types<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-account-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>General purpose Azure storage accounts have two types: Standard and Premium.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Standard</strong> storage accounts are backed by magnetic hard disk drives (HDD). A standard storage account provides the lowest cost per GB. You can use Standard storage for applications that require bulk storage or where data is infrequently accessed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Premium</strong> storage accounts are backed by solid-state drives (SSD) and offer consistent low-latency performance. You can use Premium storage for Azure virtual machine disks with I/O-intensive applications like databases.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You can't convert a Standard storage account to a Premium storage account or vice versa. You must create a new storage account with the desired type and copy data, if applicable, to a new storage account.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-consider-when-using-azure-storage">Things to consider when using Azure Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-consider-when-using-azure-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As you think about your configuration plan for Azure Storage, consider these prominent features.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider durability and availability</strong>. Azure Storage is durable and highly available. Redundancy ensures your data is safe during transient hardware failures. You replicate data across datacenters or geographical regions for protection from local catastrophe or natural disaster. Replicated data remains highly available during an unexpected outage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider secure access</strong>. Azure Storage encrypts all data. Azure Storage provides you with fine-grained control over who has access to your data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider scalability</strong>. Azure Storage is designed to be massively scalable to meet the data storage and performance needs of modern applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider manageability</strong>. Microsoft Azure handles hardware maintenance, updates, and critical issues for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider data accessibility</strong>. Data in Azure Storage is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Microsoft provides SDKs for Azure Storage in various languages. You can use .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, and the REST API. Azure Storage supports scripting in Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI. The Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer offer easy visual solutions for working with your data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="explore-azure-storage-services">Explore Azure Storage services<a class="headerlink" href="#explore-azure-storage-services" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Azure Storage offers four data services that can be accessed by using an Azure storage account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Blob Storage (containers)</strong>: A massively scalable object store for text and binary data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Files</strong>: Managed file shares for cloud or on-premises deployments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Queue Storage</strong>: A messaging store for reliable messaging between application components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure Table Storage</strong>: A service that stores nonrelational structured data (also known as structured NoSQL data).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's examine the details of these services.</p>
<h3 id="azure-blob-storage-containers">Azure Blob Storage (containers)<a class="headerlink" href="#azure-blob-storage-containers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft's object storage solution for the cloud. Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured or <em>nonrelational</em> data, such as text or binary data. Blob Storage is ideal for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serving images or documents directly to a browser.</li>
<li>Storing files for distributed access.</li>
<li>Streaming video and audio.</li>
<li>Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.</li>
<li>Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Objects in Blob Storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. Users or client applications can access blobs via URLs, the Azure Storage REST API, Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or an Azure Storage client library. The storage client libraries are available for multiple languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, and Ruby.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You can access data from Azure Blob Storage <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/access-data-azure-blob-storage-multiple-protocols/4-access-data-azure-blob-storage-nfs-protocol">by using the NFS protocol</a>.</p>
<h3 id="azure-files">Azure Files<a class="headerlink" href="#azure-files" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Files enables you to set up highly available network file shares. Shares can be accessed by using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the Network File System (NFS) protocol. Multiple virtual machines can share the same files with both read and write access. You can also read the files by using the REST interface or the storage client libraries.</p>
<p>File shares can be used for many common scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many on-premises applications use file shares. This feature makes it easier to migrate those applications that share data to Azure. If you mount the file share to the same drive letter that the on-premises application uses, the part of your application that accesses the file share should work with minimal, if any, changes.</li>
<li>Configuration files can be stored on a file share and accessed from multiple virtual machines. Tools and utilities used by multiple developers in a group can be stored on a file share, ensuring that everybody can find them, and that they use the same version.</li>
<li>Diagnostic logs, metrics, and crash dumps are just three examples of data that can be written to a file share and processed or analyzed later.</li>
</ul>
<p>The storage account credentials are used to provide authentication for access to the file share. All users who have the share mounted should have full read/write access to the share.</p>
<h3 id="azure-queue-storage">Azure Queue Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#azure-queue-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Queue Storage is used to store and retrieve messages. Queue messages can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages. Queues are used to store lists of messages to be processed asynchronously.</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where you want your customers to be able to upload pictures, and you want to create thumbnails for each picture. You could have your customer wait for you to create the thumbnails while uploading the pictures. An alternative is to use a queue. When the customer finishes the upload, you can write a message to the queue. Then you can use an Azure Function to retrieve the message from the queue and create the thumbnails. Each of the processing parts can be scaled separately, which gives you more control when tuning the configuration.</p>
<h3 id="azure-table-storage">Azure Table Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#azure-table-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Table storage is a service that stores non-relational structured data (also known as structured NoSQL data) in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Because Table storage is schemaless, it's easy to adapt your data as the needs of your application evolve. Access to Table storage data is fast and cost-effective for many types of applications, and is typically lower in cost than traditional SQL for similar volumes of data. In addition to the existing Azure Table Storage service, there's a new Azure Cosmos DB Table API offering that provides throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes.</p>

<p>As you think about your configuration plan for Azure Storage, consider the prominent features of the types of Azure Storage and which options support your application needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider storage optimization for massive data</strong>. Azure Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. Objects in Blob Storage can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS. Blob Storage is ideal for serving data directly to a browser, streaming data, and storing data for backup and restore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider storage with high availability</strong>. Azure Files supports highly available network file shares. On-premises apps use file shares for easy migration. By using Azure Files, all users can access shared data and tools. Storage account credentials provide file share authentication to ensure all users who have the file share mounted have the correct read/write access.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider storage for messages</strong>. Use Azure Queue Storage to store large numbers of messages. Queue Storage is commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider storage for structured data</strong>. Azure Table Storage is ideal for storing structured, nonrelational data. It provides throughput-optimized tables, global distribution, and automatic secondary indexes. Because Azure Table Storage is part of Azure Cosmos DB, you have access to a fully managed NoSQL database service for modern app development.</p>

<h1 id="determine-replication-strategies">Determine replication strategies<a class="headerlink" href="#determine-replication-strategies" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The data in your Azure storage account is always replicated to ensure durability and high availability. Azure Storage replication copies your data to protect from planned and unplanned events. These events range from transient hardware failures, network or power outages, massive natural disasters, and so on. You can choose to replicate your data within the same data center, across zonal data centers within the same region, and even across regions. Replication ensures your storage account meets the Service-Level Agreement (SLA) for Azure Storage even if there are failures.</p>
<p>We explore four replication strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locally redundant storage (LRS)</li>
<li>Zone redundant storage (ZRS)</li>
<li>Geo-redundant storage (GRS)</li>
<li>Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="locally-redundant-storage">Locally redundant storage<a class="headerlink" href="#locally-redundant-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Locally redundant storage is the lowest-cost replication option and offers the least durability compared to other strategies. If a data center-level disaster occurs, such as fire or flooding, all replicas might be lost or unrecoverable. Despite its limitations, LRS can be appropriate in several scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your application stores data that can be easily reconstructed if data loss occurs.</li>
<li>Your data is constantly changing like in a live feed, and storing the data isn't essential.</li>
<li>Your application is restricted to replicating data only within a country/region due to data governance requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zone-redundant-storage">Zone redundant storage<a class="headerlink" href="#zone-redundant-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Zone redundant storage synchronously replicates your data across three storage clusters in a single region. Each storage cluster is physically separated from the others and resides in its own availability zone. Each availability zone, and the ZRS cluster within it, is autonomous, and has separate utilities and networking capabilities. Storing your data in a ZRS account ensures you can access and manage your data if a zone becomes unavailable. ZRS provides excellent performance and low latency.</p>
<ul>
<li>ZRS isn't currently available in all regions.</li>
<li>Changing to ZRS from another data replication option requires the physical data movement from a single storage stamp to multiple stamps within a region.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="geo-redundant-storage">Geo-redundant storage<a class="headerlink" href="#geo-redundant-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Geo-redundant storage replicates your data to a secondary region (hundreds of miles away from the primary location of the source data). GRS provides a higher level of durability even during a regional outage. GRS is designed to provide at least 99.99999999999999% <strong>(16 9's) durability</strong>. When your storage account has GRS enabled, your data is durable even when there's a complete regional outage or a disaster where the primary region isn't recoverable.</p>
<p>If you implement GRS, you have two related options to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GRS</strong> replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region. The data is available to be read only if Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to secondary region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Read-access geo-redundant storage</strong> (RA-GRS) is based on GRS. RA-GRS replicates your data to another data center in a secondary region, and also provides you with the option to read from the secondary region. With RA-GRS, you can read from the secondary region regardless of whether Microsoft initiates a failover from the primary to the secondary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a storage account with GRS or RA-GRS enabled, all data is first replicated with locally redundant storage. An update is first committed to the primary location and replicated by using LRS. The update is then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region by using GRS. Data in the secondary region uses LRS. Both the primary and secondary regions manage replicas across separate fault domains and upgrade domains within a storage scale unit. The storage scale unit is the basic replication unit within the datacenter. Replication at this level is provided by LRS.</p>
<h3 id="geo-zone-redundant-storage">Geo-zone redundant storage<a class="headerlink" href="#geo-zone-redundant-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Geo-zone-redundant storage combines the high availability of zone-redundant storage with protection from regional outages as provided by geo-redundant storage. Data in a GZRS storage account is replicated across three Azure availability zones in the primary region, and also replicated to a secondary geographic region for protection from regional disasters. Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography, together making a regional pair.</p>
<p>With a GZRS storage account, you can continue to read and write data if an availability zone becomes unavailable or is unrecoverable. Additionally, your data is also durable during a complete regional outage or during a disaster in which the primary region isn't recoverable. GZRS is designed to provide at least 99.99999999999999% (16 9's) durability of objects over a given year. GZRS also offers the same scalability targets as LRS, ZRS, GRS, or RA-GRS. You can optionally enable read access to data in the secondary region with read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).</p>
<p>Tip</p>
<p>Microsoft recommends using GZRS for applications that require consistency, durability, high availability, excellent performance, and resilience for disaster recovery. Enable RA-GZRS for read access to a secondary region when there's a regional disaster.</p>

<p>Let's examine the scope of durability and availability for the different replication strategies. The following table describes several key factors during the replication process, including node unavailability within a data center, and whether the entire data center (zonal or nonzonal) becomes unavailable. The table identifies read access to data in a remote, geo-replicated region during region-wide unavailability, and the supported Azure storage account types.</p>

<h1 id="access-storage">Access storage<a class="headerlink" href="#access-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Every object you store in Azure Storage has a unique URL address. Your storage account name forms the <em>subdomain</em> portion of the URL address. The combination of the subdomain and the domain name, which is specific to each service, forms an endpoint for your storage account.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example. If your storage account name is <em>mystorageaccount</em>, default endpoints for your storage account are formed for the Azure services as shown in the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Service</th>
<th>Default endpoint</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Container service</strong></td>
<td><code>//</code><strong><code>mystorageaccount</code></strong><code>.blob.core.windows.net</code></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>File service</strong></td>
<td><code>//</code><strong><code>mystorageaccount</code></strong><code>.file.core.windows.net</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We create the URL to access an object in your storage account by appending the object's location in the storage account to the endpoint.</p>
<p>To access the <em>myblob</em> data in the <em>mycontainer</em> location in your storage account, we use the following URL address:</p>
<p><code>//</code><strong><code>mystorageaccount</code></strong><code>.blob.core.windows.net/</code><strong><code>mycontainer</code></strong><code>/</code><strong><code>myblob</code></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="configure-custom-domains">Configure custom domains<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-custom-domains" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You can configure a custom domain to access blob data in your Azure storage account. As we reviewed, the default endpoint for Azure Blob Storage is <code>\&lt;storage-account-name&gt;.blob.core.windows.net</code>. If you map a custom domain and subdomain, such as <code>www.contoso.com</code>, to the blob or web endpoint for your storage account, your users can use that domain to access blob data in your storage account.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Azure Storage doesn't currently provide native support for HTTPS with custom domains. You can implement an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to access blobs by using custom domains over HTTPS.</p>
<p>There are two ways to configure a custom domain: direct mapping and intermediary domain mapping.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Direct mapping</strong> lets you enable a custom domain for a subdomain to an Azure storage account. For this approach, you create a <code>CNAME</code> record that points from the subdomain to the Azure storage account.</p>
<p>The following example shows how a subdomain is mapped to an Azure storage account to create a <code>CNAME</code> record in the domain name system (DNS):</p>
<ul>
<li>Subdomain: <code>blobs.contoso.com</code></li>
<li>Azure storage account: <code>\&lt;storage account&gt;\.blob.core.windows.net</code></li>
<li>Direct <code>CNAME</code> record: <code>contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net</code></li>
<li><strong>Intermediary domain mapping</strong> is applied to a domain that's already in use within Azure. This approach might result in minor downtime while the domain is being mapped. To avoid downtime, you can use the <code>asverify</code> intermediary domain to validate the domain. By prepending the <code>asverify</code> keyword to your own subdomain, you permit Azure to recognize your custom domain without modifying the DNS record for the domain. After you modify the DNS record for the domain, your domain is mapped to the blob endpoint with no downtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example shows how a domain in use is mapped to an Azure storage account in the DNS with the <code>asverify</code> intermediary domain:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CNAME</code> record: <strong><code>asverify</code></strong><code>.blobs.contoso.com</code></li>
<li>Intermediate <code>CNAME</code> record: <strong><code>asverify</code></strong><code>.contosoblobs.blob.core.windows.net</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In the Azure portal, each Azure service requires certain steps to configure the service endpoints and restrict network access.</p>
<p>To access these settings for your storage account, you use the <strong>Firewalls and virtual networks</strong> settings. You add the virtual networks that should have access to the service for the account.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the Storage Account Firewalls and virtual networks settings in the Azure portal.

<p>Here are some points to consider about configuring service access settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Firewalls and virtual networks</strong> settings restrict access to your storage account from specific subnets on virtual networks or public IPs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can configure the service to allow access to one or more public IP ranges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subnets and virtual networks must exist in the same Azure region or region pair as your storage account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Important</p>
<p>Be sure to test the service endpoint and verify the endpoint limits access as expected.</p>

<p>Let's examine some configuration characteristics of Blob Storage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blob Storage can store any type of text or binary data. Some examples are text documents, images, video files, and application installers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blob Storage uses three resources to store and manage your data:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Azure storage account</li>
<li>Containers in an Azure storage account</li>
<li>Blobs in a container</li>
<li>
<p>To implement Blob Storage, you configure several settings:</p>

<p>In the Azure portal, you configure two settings to create a container for an Azure storage account. As you review these details, consider how you might organize containers in your storage account.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot that shows the container creation page and the public access level choices in the Azure portal." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-blob-storage/media/blob-containers-a243a2b9.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Name</strong>: Enter a name for your container. The name must be unique within the Azure storage account.</p>
<ul>
<li>The name can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.</li>
<li>The name must begin with a letter or a number.</li>
<li>The minimum length for the name is three characters.</li>
<li>The maximum length for the name is 63 characters.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Public access level</strong>: The access level specifies whether the container and its blobs can be accessed publicly. By default, container data is private and visible only to the account owner. There are three access level choices:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Private</strong>: (Default) Prohibit anonymous access to the container and blobs.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Blob</strong>: Allow anonymous public read access for the blobs only.</li>
<li><strong>Container</strong>: Allow anonymous public read and list access to the entire container, including the blobs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note</p>
<p>You can also create a blob container with PowerShell by using the <code>New-AzStorageContainer</code> command.</p>

<p>Azure Storage supports several access tiers for blob data, including Hot, Cool, and Archive. Each access tier is optimized to support a particular pattern of data usage.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-blob-access-tiers">Things to know about blob access tiers<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-blob-access-tiers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let's examine characteristics of the blob access tiers.</p>
<h4 id="hot-tier">Hot tier<a class="headerlink" href="#hot-tier" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The Hot tier is optimized for frequent reads and writes of objects in the Azure storage account. A good usage case is data that is actively being processed. By default, new storage accounts are created in the Hot tier. This tier has the lowest access costs, but higher storage costs than the Cool and Archive tiers.</p>
<h4 id="cool-tier">Cool tier<a class="headerlink" href="#cool-tier" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The Cool tier is optimized for storing large amounts of data that's infrequently accessed. This tier is intended for data that remains in the Cool tier for at least 30 days. A usage case for the Cool tier is short-term backup and disaster recovery datasets and older media content. This content shouldn't be viewed frequently, but it needs to be immediately available. Storing data in the Cool tier is more cost-effective. Accessing data in the Cool tier can be more expensive than accessing data in the Hot tier.</p>
<h4 id="cold-tier">Cold tier<a class="headerlink" href="#cold-tier" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The Cold tier is also optimized for storing large amounts of data that's infrequently accessed. This tier is intended for data that can remain in the tier for at least 90 days.</p>
<h4 id="archive-tier">Archive tier<a class="headerlink" href="#archive-tier" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The Archive tier is an offline tier that's optimized for data that can tolerate several hours of retrieval latency. Data must remain in the Archive tier for at least 180 days or be subject to an early deletion charge. Data for the Archive tier includes secondary backups, original raw data, and legally required compliance information. This tier is the most cost-effective option for storing data. Accessing data is more expensive in the Archive tier than accessing data in the other tiers.</p>
<h3 id="compare-access-tiers">Compare access tiers<a class="headerlink" href="#compare-access-tiers" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The access options for Azure Blob Storage offer a range of features and support levels to help you optimize your storage costs. As you compare the features and support, think about which access options can best support your application needs.</p>

<p>In the Azure portal, you can select the blob access tier for your Azure storage account. You can also change the blob access tier for your account at any time. By selecting the correct access tier for your needs, you can store your blob data in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
<h1 id="add-blob-lifecycle-management-rules">Add blob lifecycle management rules<a class="headerlink" href="#add-blob-lifecycle-management-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Every data set has a unique lifecycle. Early in the lifecycle, users tend to access some of the data in the set, but not all of the data. As the data set ages, access to all of the data in the set tends to dramatically reduce. Some data set stays idle in the cloud and is rarely accessed after it's stored. Some data expires within a few days or months after it's created. Other data is actively read and modified throughout the data set lifetime.</p>
<p>Azure Blob Storage supports lifecycle management for data sets. It offers a rich rule-based policy for GPv2 and Blob Storage accounts. You can use lifecycle policy rules to transition your data to the appropriate access tiers, and set expiration times for the end of a data set's lifecycle.</p>

<p>You can use Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management policy rules to accomplish several tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transition blobs to a cooler storage tier (Hot to Cool, Hot to Archive, Cool to Archive) to optimize for performance and cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete blobs at the end of their lifecycles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define rule-based conditions to run once per day at the Azure storage account level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply rule-based conditions to containers or a subset of blobs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="business-scenario">Business scenario<a class="headerlink" href="#business-scenario" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Consider a scenario where data is frequently accessed in the early stages of the lifecycle, but only occasionally after two weeks. After the first month, the data set is rarely accessed. In this scenario, the Hot tier of Blob Storage is best during the early stages. Cool tier storage is most appropriate for occasional access. Archive tier storage is the best option after the data ages over a month. To achieve this transition, lifecycle management policy rules are available to move aging data to cooler tiers.</p>
<h3 id="configure-lifecycle-management-policy-rules">Configure lifecycle management policy rules<a class="headerlink" href="#configure-lifecycle-management-policy-rules" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In the Azure portal, you create lifecycle management policy rules for your Azure storage account by specifying several settings. For each rule, you create <strong>If - Then</strong> block conditions to transition or expire data based on your specifications. As you review these details, consider how you can set up lifecycle management policy rules for your data sets.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot that shows how to add a lifecycle management policy rule for blob data in the Azure portal." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-blob-storage/media/blob-lifecycle-2854d812.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If</strong>: The <strong>If</strong> clause sets the evaluation clause for the policy rule. When the <strong>If</strong> clause evaluates to true, the <strong>Then</strong> clause is executed. Use the <strong>If</strong> clause to set the time period to apply to the blob data. The lifecycle management feature checks if the data is accessed or modified according to the specified time.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More than (days ago)</strong>: The number of days to use in the evaluation condition.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Then</strong>: The <strong>Then</strong> clause sets the action clause for the policy rule. When the <strong>If</strong> clause evaluates to true, the <strong>Then</strong> clause is executed. Use the <strong>Then</strong> clause to set the transition action for the blob data. The lifecycle management feature transitions the data based on the setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Move to cool storage</strong>: The blob data is transitioned to Cool tier storage.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Move to archive storage</strong>: The blob data is transitioned to Archive tier storage.</li>
<li><strong>Delete the blob</strong>: The blob data is deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By designing policy rules to adjust storage tiers in respect to the age of data, you can design the least expensive storage options for your needs.</p>
<h1 id="determine-blob-object-replication">Determine blob object replication<a class="headerlink" href="#determine-blob-object-replication" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Object replication copies blobs in a container asynchronously according to policy rules that you configure. During the replication process, the following contents are copied from the source container to the destination container:</p>
<ul>
<li>The blob contents</li>
<li>The blob metadata and properties</li>
<li>Any versions of data associated with the blob</li>
</ul>
<p>The following illustration shows an example of asynchronous replication of blob containers between regions.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram that shows asynchronous replication of blob containers between regions." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-blob-storage/media/blob-object-replication-21fd3c07.png" /></p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-blob-object-replication">Things to know about blob object replication<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-blob-object-replication" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are several considerations to keep in mind when planning your configuration for blob object replication.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Object replication requires that blob versioning is enabled on both the source and destination accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object replication doesn't support blob snapshots. Any snapshots on a blob in the source account aren't replicated to the destination account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object replication is supported when the source and destination accounts are in the Hot, Cool, or Cold tier. The source and destination accounts can be in different tiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you configure object replication, you create a replication policy that specifies the source Azure storage account and the destination storage account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A replication policy includes one or more rules that specify a source container and a destination container. The policy identifies the blobs in the source container to replicate.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many benefits to using blob object replication. Consider the following scenarios and think about how replication can be a part of your Blob Storage strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider latency reductions</strong>. Minimize latency with blob object replication. You can reduce latency for read requests by enabling clients to consume data from a region that's in closer physical proximity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider efficiency for compute workloads</strong>. Improve efficiency for compute workloads by using blob object replication. With object replication, compute workloads can process the same sets of blobs in different regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider data distribution</strong>. Optimize your configuration for data distribution. You can process or analyze data in a single location and then replicate only the results to other regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider costs benefits</strong>. Manage your configuration and optimize your storage policies to achieve cost benefits. After your data is replicated, you can reduce costs by moving the data to the Archive tier by using lifecycle management policies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="upload-blobs">Upload blobs<a class="headerlink" href="#upload-blobs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>A blob can be any type of data and any size file. Azure Storage offers three types of blobs: <em>block blob</em>, <em>page blob</em>, and <em>append blob</em>.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-blob-types">Things to know about blob types<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-blob-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the characteristics of blob types.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Block blobs</strong>. A block blob consists of blocks of data that are assembled to make a blob. Most Blob Storage scenarios use block blobs. Block blobs are ideal for storing text and binary data in the cloud, like files, images, and videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Append blobs</strong>. An append blob is similar to a block blob because the append blob also consists of blocks of data. The blocks of data in an append blob are optimized for <em>append</em> operations. Append blobs are useful for logging scenarios, where the amount of data can increase as the logging operation continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Page blobs</strong>. A page blob can be up to 8 TB in size. Page blobs are more efficient for frequent read/write operations. Azure Virtual Machines uses page blobs for operating system disks and data disks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The block blob type is the default type for a new blob. When you're creating a new blob, if you don't choose a specific type, the new blob is created as a block blob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you create a blob, you can't change its type.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Review the following billing considerations for an Azure storage account and Blob Storage.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance tiers</strong>. The Blob Storage tier determines the amount of data stored and the cost for storing that data. As the performance tier gets cooler, the per-gigabyte cost decreases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data access costs</strong>. Data access charges increase as the tier gets cooler. For data in the Cool and Archive tiers, you're billed a per-gigabyte data access charge for reads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transaction costs</strong>. There's a per-transaction charge for all tiers. The charge increases as the tier gets cooler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geo-replication data transfer costs</strong>. This charge only applies to accounts that have geo-replication configured, including GRS and RA-GRS. Geo-replication data transfer incurs a per-gigabyte charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Outbound data transfer costs</strong>. Outbound data transfers (data that's transferred out of an Azure region) incur billing for bandwidth usage on a per-gigabyte basis. This billing is consistent with general-purpose Azure storage accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changes to the storage tier</strong>. If you change the account storage tier from Cool to Hot, you incur a charge equal to reading all the data existing in the storage account. Changing the account storage tier from Hot to Cool incurs a charge equal to writing all the data into the Cool tier (GPv2 accounts only).</p>

<p>Let's look at some characteristics of Azure Storage security.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong>. All data written to Azure Storage is automatically encrypted by using Azure Storage encryption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authentication</strong>. Microsoft Entra ID and role-based access control (RBAC) are supported for Azure Storage for both resource management operations and data operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assign RBAC roles scoped to an Azure storage account to security principals, and use Microsoft Entra ID to authorize resource management operations like key management.</li>
<li>Microsoft Entra integration is supported for data operations on Azure Blob Storage and Azure Queue Storage.</li>
<li><strong>Data in transit</strong>. Data can be secured in transit between an application and Azure by using Client-Side Encryption, HTTPS, or SMB 3.0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disk encryption</strong>. Operating system disks and data disks used by Azure Virtual Machines can be encrypted by using Azure Disk Encryption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shared access signatures</strong>. Delegated access to the data objects in Azure Storage can be granted by using a shared access signature (SAS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Authorization</strong>. Every request made against a secured resource in Blob Storage, Azure Files, Queue Storage, or Azure Cosmos DB (Azure Table Storage) must be authorized. Authorization ensures that resources in your storage account are accessible only when you want them to be, and to only those users or applications whom you grant access.</p>

<p>A shared access signature (SAS) is a uniform resource identifier (URI) that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources. SAS is a secure way to share your storage resources without compromising your account keys.</p>
<p>You can provide a SAS to clients who shouldn't have access to your storage account key. By distributing a SAS URI to these clients, you grant them access to a resource for a specified period of time.</p>

<p>Let's review some characteristics of a SAS.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A SAS gives you granular control over the type of access you grant to clients who have the SAS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An account-level SAS can delegate access to multiple Azure Storage services, such as blobs, files, queues, and tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can specify the time interval for which a SAS is valid, including the start time and the expiration time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You specify the permissions granted by the SAS. A SAS for a blob might grant read and write permissions to that blob, but not delete permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SAS provides account-level and service-level control.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Account-level</strong> SAS delegates access to resources in one or more Azure Storage services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service-level</strong> SAS delegates access to a resource in only one Azure Storage service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note</p>
<p>A <strong>stored access policy</strong> can provide another level of control when you use a service-level SAS on the server side. You can group SASs and provide other restrictions by using a stored access policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are optional SAS configuration settings:</p>
<ul>

<p>Let's look at some recommendations that can help mitigate risks when working with a SAS.</p>
<p>Expand table</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Recommendation</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Always use HTTPS for creation and distribution</strong></td>
<td>If a SAS is passed over HTTP and intercepted, an attacker can intercept and use the SAS. These <em>man-in-the-middle</em> attacks can compromise sensitive data or allow for data corruption by the malicious user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Reference stored access policies where possible</strong></td>
<td>Stored access policies give you the option to revoke permissions without having to regenerate the Azure storage account keys. Set the storage account key expiration date far in the future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Set near-term expiry times for an unplanned SAS</strong></td>
<td>If a SAS is compromised, you can mitigate attacks by limiting the SAS validity to a short time. This practice is important if you can't reference a stored access policy. Near-term expiration times also limit the amount of data that can be written to a blob by limiting the time available to upload to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Require clients automatically renew the SAS</strong></td>
<td>Require your clients to renew the SAS well before the expiration date. By renewing early, you allow time for retries if the service providing the SAS is unavailable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Plan carefully for the SAS start time</strong></td>
<td>If you set the start time for a SAS to now, then due to clock skew (differences in current time according to different machines), failures might be observed intermittently for the first few minutes. In general, set the start time to at least 15 minutes in the past. Or, don't set a specific start time, which causes the SAS to be valid immediately in all cases. The same conditions generally apply to the expiry time. You might observe up to 15 minutes of clock skew in either direction on any request. For clients that use a REST API version earlier than 2012-02-12, the maximum duration for a SAS that doesn't reference a stored access policy is 1 hour. Any policies that specify a longer term will fail.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Define minimum access permissions for resources</strong></td>
<td>A security best practice is to provide a user with the minimum required privileges. If a user only needs read access to a single entity, then grant them read access to that single entity, and not read/write/delete access to all entities. This practice also helps lessen the damage if a SAS is compromised because the SAS has less power in the hands of an attacker.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Understand account billing for usage, including a SAS</strong></td>
<td>If you provide write access to a blob, a user might choose to upload a 200-GB blob. If you've given them read access as well, they might choose to download the blob 10 times, which incurs 2 TB in egress costs for you. Again, provide limited permissions to help mitigate the potential actions of malicious users. Use a short-lived SAS to reduce this threat, but be mindful of clock skew on the end time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Validate data written by using a SAS</strong></td>
<td>When a client application writes data to your Azure storage account, keep in mind there can be problems with the data. If your application requires validated or authorized data, validate the data after it's written, but before it's used. This practice also protects against corrupt or malicious data being written to your account, either by a user who properly acquired the SAS, or by a user exploiting a leaked SAS.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Don't assume a SAS is always the correct choice</strong></td>
<td>In some scenarios, the risks associated with a particular operation against your Azure storage account outweigh the benefits of using a SAS. For such operations, create a middle-tier service that writes to your storage account after performing business rule validation, authentication, and auditing. Also, sometimes it's easier to manage access in other ways. If you want to make all blobs in a container publicly readable, you can make the container Public, rather than providing a SAS to every client for access.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Monitor your applications with Azure Storage Analytics</strong></td>
<td>You can use logging and metrics to observe any spike in authentication failures. You might see spikes from an outage in your SAS provider service or to the inadvertent removal of a stored access policy.</td>
</tr>

<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction">Azure Files</a> offers shared storage for applications by using the industry standard <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa365233.aspx">Server Message Block</a> and Network File System (NFS) protocols. Azure virtual machines (VMs) and cloud services can share file data across application components by using mounted shares. On-premises applications can also access file data in the share.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-azure-files">Things to know about Azure Files<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-azure-files" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let's examine some characteristics of Azure Files.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Azure Files stores data as true directory objects in file shares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Azure Files provides shared access to files across multiple VMs. Any number of Azure virtual machines or roles can mount and access an Azure file share simultaneously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applications that run in Azure VMs or cloud services can mount an Azure file share to access file data. This process is similar to how a desktop application mounts a typical SMB share.</p>

<p>There are many common scenarios for using Azure Files. As you review the following suggestions, think about how Azure Files can provide solutions for your organization.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider replacement and supplement options</strong>. Replace or supplement traditional on-premises file servers or NAS devices by using Azure Files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider global access</strong>. Directly access Azure file shares by using most operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, from anywhere in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider lift and shift support</strong>. <em>Lift and shift</em> applications to the cloud with Azure Files for apps that expect a file share to store file application or user data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider using Azure File Sync</strong>. Replicate Azure file shares to Windows Servers by using Azure File Sync. You can replicate on-premises or in the cloud for performance and distributed caching of the data where it's being used. We'll take a closer look at Azure File Sync in a later unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider shared applications</strong>. Store shared application settings such as configuration files in Azure Files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider diagnostic data</strong>. Use Azure Files to store diagnostic data such as logs, metrics, and crash dumps in a shared location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider tools and utilities</strong>. Azure Files is a good option for storing tools and utilities that are needed for developing or administering Azure VMs or cloud services.</p>

<h1 id="manage-azure-file-shares">Manage Azure file shares<a class="headerlink" href="#manage-azure-file-shares" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Azure Files offers two industry-standard file system protocols for mounting Azure file shares: the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and the Network File System (NFS) protocol. Azure file shares don't support both the SMB and NFS protocols on the same file share, although you can create SMB and NFS Azure file shares within the same storage account.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-azure-file-shares">Types of Azure file shares<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-azure-file-shares" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Azure also offers two types of file shares: standard and premium. There are key differences between premium and standard file shares:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The premium tier stores data on modern solid-state drives (SSDs), while the standard tier uses hard disk drives (HDDs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard file shares can be used with SMB and REST protocols only, while premium file shares can be used with SMB, NFS, and REST protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can easily switch between hot, cool, and transaction optimized tiers of standard file shares, but you can't switch from premium file shares to any of the standard tiers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-smb-azure-file-shares">Creating SMB Azure file shares<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-smb-azure-file-shares" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are two important settings that you need to be aware of when creating and configuring SMB Azure file shares.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Open port 445</strong>. SMB communicates over TCP port 445. Make sure port 445 is open. Also, make sure your firewall isn't blocking TCP port 445 from the client machine. If you can't unblock port 445, then a VPN or ExpressRoute connection from on-premises to your Azure network is required, with Azure Files exposed on your internal network using private endpoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enable secure transfer</strong>. The <code>Secure transfer required</code> setting enhances the security of your storage account by limiting requests to your storage account from secure connections only. Consider the scenario where you use REST APIs to access your storage account. If you attempt to connect, and secure transfer required is enabled, you must connect by using HTTPS. If you try to connect to your account by using HTTP, and secure transfer required is enabled, the connection is rejected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mount-an-smb-azure-file-share-on-windows">Mount an SMB Azure file share on Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#mount-an-smb-azure-file-share-on-windows" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You can use Azure file shares seamlessly in Windows and Windows Server. You can connect to your Azure file share with Windows or Windows Server in the Azure portal. Specify the <strong>Drive</strong> where you want to mount the share, and choose the <strong>Authentication method</strong>. The Azure portal supplies you with PowerShell commands to run when you're ready to work with the file share. This video shows you how to mount the SMB file share on Windows.</p>

<p>You can also connect to Azure file shares from Linux machines. From your virtual machine page, select <strong>Connect</strong>. SMB Azure file shares can be mounted in Linux distributions by using the CIFS kernel client. File mounting can be done on-demand with the <code>mount</code> command or on-boot (persistent) by creating an entry in /etc/fstab.</p>
<h1 id="create-file-share-snapshots">Create file share snapshots<a class="headerlink" href="#create-file-share-snapshots" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Azure Files provides the capability to take share <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-snapshots-files">snapshots of file shares</a>. File share snapshots capture a point-in-time, read-only copy of your data.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of a file share snapshot that shows the snapshot name and date it was created." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-azure-files-file-sync/media/file-share-snapshot-cbda2136.png" /></p>
<h3 id="things-to-know-about-file-share-snapshots">Things to know about file share snapshots<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-know-about-file-share-snapshots" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Let's review some characteristics of file share snapshots.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Azure Files share snapshot capability is provided at the file share level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share snapshots are incremental in nature. Only data changed since the most recent share snapshot is saved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incremental snapshots minimize the time required to create share snapshots and saves on storage costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though share snapshots are saved incrementally, you only need to retain the most recent share snapshot to restore the share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can retrieve a share snapshot for an individual file. This level of support helps with restoring individual files rather than having to restore to the entire file share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share snapshots provide only file-level protection. They don't prevent fat-finger deletions on a file share or storage account. If you delete a file share that has share snapshots, all of its snapshots will be deleted along with the share.</p>

<td><strong><em>Protect against application error and data corruption</em></strong></td>
<td>Applications that use file shares perform operations like writing, reading, storage, transmission, and processing. When an application is misconfigured or an unintentional bug is introduced, accidental overwrite or damage can happen to a few data blocks. To help protect against these scenarios, you can take a share snapshot before you deploy new application code. When a bug or application error is introduced with the new deployment, you can go back to a previous version of your data on that file share.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>Protect against accidental deletions or unintended changes</em></strong></td>
<td>Imagine you're working on a text file in a file share. After the text file is closed, you lose the ability to undo your changes. In this scenario, you need to recover a previous version of your file. You can use share snapshots to recover previous versions of the file if it's accidentally renamed or deleted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><em>Support backup and recovery</em></strong></td>
<td>After you create a file share, you can periodically create a snapshot of the file share to use it for data backup. A share snapshot, when taken periodically, helps maintain previous versions of data that can be used for future audit requirements or disaster recovery.</td>

<p>Azure Storage Explorer lets you attach to external storage accounts so storage accounts can be easily shared.</p>
<p>To create the connection, you need the external storage <strong>Account name</strong> and <strong>Account key</strong>. In the Azure portal, the account key is called <strong>key1</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the Azure Storage Explorer wizard to connect to an external storage account." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-azure-files-file-sync/media/attach-name-key-13fe3ba3.png" /></p>

<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/file-sync/file-sync-introduction">Azure File Sync</a> enables you to cache several Azure Files shares on an on-premises Windows Server or cloud virtual machine. You can use Azure File Sync to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server.</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration that depicts how Azure File Sync can be used to cache an organization's file shares in Azure Files." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-azure-files-file-sync/media/file-sync-1d3fd2e7.png" /></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Azure File Sync transforms Windows Server into a quick cache of your Azure Files shares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use any protocol that's available on Windows Server to access your data locally with Azure File Sync, including SMB, NFS, and FTPS.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="cloud-tiering">Cloud tiering<a class="headerlink" href="#cloud-tiering" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Cloud tiering is an optional feature of Azure File Sync. Frequently accessed files are cached locally on the server while all other files are tiered to Azure Files based on policy settings.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a file is tiered, Azure File Sync replaces the file locally with a pointer. A pointer is commonly referred to as a <em>reparse point</em>. The reparse point represents a URL to the file in Azure Files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a user opens a tiered file, Azure File Sync seamlessly recalls the file data from Azure Files without the user needing to know that the file is stored in Azure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloud tiering files have greyed icons with an offline <code>O</code> file attribute to let the user know when the file is only in Azure.</p>

<p>There are many advantages to using Azure File Sync. Consider the following scenarios, and think about how you can use Azure File Sync with your Azure Files shares.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider application lift and shift</strong>. Use Azure File Sync to move applications that require access between Azure and on-premises systems. Provide write access to the same data across Windows Servers and Azure Files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider support for branch offices</strong>. Support your branch offices that need to back up files by using Azure File Sync. Use the service to set up a new server that connects to Azure storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider backup and disaster recovery</strong>. After you implement Azure File Sync, Azure Backup backs up your on-premises data. Restore file metadata immediately and recall data as needed for rapid disaster recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider file archiving with cloud tiering</strong>. Azure File Sync stores only recently accessed data on local servers. Implement cloud tiering so non-used data moves to Azure Files.</p>

<p>Most organizations have diverse requirements for their cloud-hosted data. For example, storing data in a specific region, or needing separate billing for different data categories. Azure storage accounts let you formalize these types of policies and apply them to your Azure data.</p>
<p>Suppose you work at a chocolate manufacturer that produces baking ingredients such as cocoa powder and chocolate chips. You market your products to grocery stores who then sell them to consumers.</p>
<p>Your formulations and manufacturing processes are trade secrets. The spreadsheets, documents, and instructional videos that capture this information are critical to your business and require geographically redundant storage. This data is primarily accessed from your main factory, so you would like to store it in a nearby datacenter. The expense for this storage needs to be billed to the manufacturing department.</p>
<p>You also have a sales group that creates cookie recipes and baking videos to promote your products to consumers. Your priority for this data is low cost, rather than redundancy or location. This storage must be billed to the sales team.</p>
<p>By creating multiple Azure storage accounts, with each one having the appropriate settings for the data it holds, you can handle these types of business requirements.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives_4">Learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-objectives_4" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>In this module, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide how many storage accounts you need for your project.</li>
<li>Determine the appropriate settings for each storage account.</li>
<li>Create a storage account using the Azure portal.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="decide-how-many-storage-accounts-you-need">Decide how many storage accounts you need<a class="headerlink" href="#decide-how-many-storage-accounts-you-need" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Organizations often have multiple storage accounts to enable them to implement different sets of requirements. In the chocolate-manufacturer example, there's one storage account for private business data and one storage account for consumer-facing files. In this unit, you learn the policy factors that each type of storage account controls, which helps you decide how many accounts you need.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-azure-storage">What is Azure Storage?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-azure-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Azure provides many ways to store your data, including multiple database options like Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Table Storage. Azure offers multiple ways to store and send messages, such as Azure Queues and Event Hubs. You can even store loose files using services like Azure Files and Azure Blobs.</p>
<p>Azure groups four of these data services together under the name <em>Azure Storage</em>. The four services are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure Blobs</li>
<li>Azure Files</li>
<li>Azure Queues</li>
<li>Azure Tables</li>
</ul>
<p>The following illustration shows the elements of Azure Storage.</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration identifying the Azure data services that are part of Azure Storage." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-storage-account/media/2-azure-storage.png" /></p>
<p>These four data services are all primitive, cloud-based storage services, and are often used together in the same application.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-storage-account">What is a storage account?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-storage-account" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A <em>storage account</em> is a container that groups a set of Azure Storage services together. Only data services from Azure Storage can be included in a storage account (Azure Blobs, Azure Files, Azure Queues, and Azure Tables). The following illustration shows a storage account containing several data services.</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration of an Azure storage account containing a mixed collection of data services." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-storage-account/media/2-what-is-a-storage-account.png" /></p>
<p>Combining data services into a single storage account enables you to manage them as a group. The settings you specify when you create the account, or any changes that you make after creation, apply to all services in the storage account. Deleting a storage account deletes all of the data stored inside it.</p>
<p>A storage account is an Azure resource and is part of a resource group. The following illustration shows an Azure subscription containing multiple resource groups, where each group contains one or more storage accounts.</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration of an Azure subscription containing multiple resource groups, each with one or more storage accounts." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-storage-account/media/2-resource-groups-and-storage-accounts.png" /></p>
<p>Other Azure data services, such as Azure SQL and Azure Cosmos DB, are managed as independent Azure resources and can't be included in a storage account. The following illustration shows a typical arrangement: Blobs, Files, Queues, and Tables are contained within storage accounts, while other services aren't.</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration of an Azure subscription showing some data services that cannot be placed in a storage account." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-storage-account/media/2-typical-subscription-organization.png" /></p>
<h2 id="storage-account-settings">Storage account settings<a class="headerlink" href="#storage-account-settings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A storage account defines a policy that applies to all the storage services in the account. For example, you could specify that all the contained services will be stored in the West US datacenter, accessible only over https, and billed to the sales department's subscription.</p>
<p>A storage account defines the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Subscription</strong>: The Azure subscription that the storage account services are billed to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: The datacenter that stores the services in the account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: Determines the data services you can have in your storage account and the type of hardware disks used to store the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard</strong> allows you to have any data service (Blob, File, Queue, Table) and uses magnetic disk drives.</li>
<li><strong>Premium</strong> provides more services for storing data. For example, storing unstructured object data as block blobs or append blobs, and specialized file storage used to store and create premium file shares. These storage accounts use solid-state drives (SSD) for storage.</li>
<li><strong>Replication</strong>: Determines the strategy used to make copies of your data to protect against hardware failure or natural disaster. At a minimum, Azure automatically maintains three copies of your data within the datacenter associated with the storage account. The minimum replication is called locally redundant storage (LRS), and guards against hardware failure but doesn't protect you from an event that incapacitates the entire datacenter. You can upgrade to one of the other options such as geo-redundant storage (GRS) to get replication at different datacenters across the world.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Access tier</strong>: Controls how quickly you're able to access the blobs in a storage account. The Hot access tier is optimized for storing frequently accessed or modified data and provides quicker access than Cool, but at increased storage cost. The Cool access tier is optimized for storing infrequently accessed or modified data, and has a lower storage cost. Hot access tier applies only to blobs, and serves as the default value for new blobs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure transfer required</strong>: A security feature that determines the supported protocols for access. Enabled requires HTTPS, while disabled allows HTTP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Virtual networks</strong>: A security feature that allows inbound access requests from only the virtual networks that you specify.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-storage-accounts-do-you-need">How many storage accounts do you need?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-many-storage-accounts-do-you-need" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A storage account represents a collection of settings like location, replication strategy, and subscription owner. You need one storage account for each group of settings that you want to apply to your data. The following illustration shows two storage accounts that differ in one setting; that one difference is enough to require separate storage accounts.</p>
<p><img alt="Illustration showing two storage accounts with different settings." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-storage-account/media/2-multiple-storage-accounts.png" /></p>
<p>Typically, your data diversity, cost sensitivity, and tolerance for management overhead determine the number of storage accounts you need.</p>
<h3 id="data-diversity">Data diversity<a class="headerlink" href="#data-diversity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Organizations often generate data that differs along several vectors. For example, where the data is consumed, how sensitive it is, which group pays the bills for it, etc. Diversity along any of these vectors can lead to multiple storage accounts. Let's consider two examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you have data that is specific to a country/region? If so, you might want to store the data in a datacenter in that country/region for performance or compliance reasons. You need one storage account for each geographical region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have some data that is proprietary and some for public consumption? If so, you could enable virtual networks for the proprietary data and not for the public data. Separating proprietary data and public data requires separate storage accounts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, increased diversity means an increased number of storage accounts.</p>
<h3 id="cost-sensitivity">Cost sensitivity<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-sensitivity" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A storage account by itself has no financial cost; however, the settings you choose for the account do influence the cost of services in the account. Geo-redundant storage costs more than locally redundant storage. Premium performance and the Hot access tier increase the cost of blobs.</p>
<p>You can use multiple storage accounts to reduce costs. For example, you could partition your data into critical and noncritical categories. You could place your critical data into a storage account with geo-redundant storage and put your noncritical data in a different storage account with locally redundant storage.</p>
<h3 id="tolerance-for-management-overhead">Tolerance for management overhead<a class="headerlink" href="#tolerance-for-management-overhead" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Each storage account requires some time and attention from an administrator to create and maintain. It also increases complexity for anyone who adds data to your cloud storage. Everyone in an administrator role needs to understand the purpose of each storage account so they add new data to the correct account.</p>
<p>Storage accounts are powerful tools to help you obtain the performance and security you need while minimizing costs. A typical strategy is to start with an analysis of your data. Create partitions that share characteristics like location, billing, and replication strategy. Then, create one storage account for each partition.</p>
<h1 id="choose-your-account-settings">Choose your account settings<a class="headerlink" href="#choose-your-account-settings" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>The storage account settings that we covered in the previous unit apply to the data services in the account. Here, we discuss the three settings that apply to the account itself, rather than to the data stored in the account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Deployment model</li>
<li>Account kind</li>
</ul>
<p>These settings affect how you manage your account and the cost of the services within it.</p>
<h2 id="name">Name<a class="headerlink" href="#name" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Each storage account has a name. The name must be globally unique within Azure, use only lowercase letters and digits, and be between 3 and 24 characters.</p>
<h2 id="deployment-model">Deployment model<a class="headerlink" href="#deployment-model" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A <em>deployment model</em> is the system Azure uses to organize your resources. The model defines the API that you use to create, configure, and manage those resources. Azure provides two deployment models, <em>Resource Manager</em> and <em>Classic</em>. Resource Manager is the current model that uses the Azure Resource Manager API. The Classic model, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/cloud-services-classic-retirement-announcement-feb2024">which is currently being retired</a>, was a legacy offering that used the classic deployment model.</p>
<p>Most Azure resources only work with Resource Manager, which makes it easy to decide which model to choose. However, storage accounts, virtual machines, and virtual networks support both, so you must choose one or the other when you create your storage account.</p>
<p>The key feature difference between the two models is their support for grouping. The Resource Manager model adds the concept of a <em>resource group</em>, which isn't available in the classic model. A resource group lets you deploy and manage a collection of resources as a single unit.</p>
<p>Microsoft recommends that you use the <strong>Resource Manager</strong> deployment model for all new resources.</p>
<h2 id="account-kind">Account kind<a class="headerlink" href="#account-kind" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Storage account <em>kind</em> is a set of policies that determine which data services you can include in the account and the pricing of those services. There are four kinds of storage accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard - StorageV2 (general purpose v2)</strong>: the current offering that supports all storage types and all of the latest features.</li>
<li><strong>Premium - Page blobs</strong>: Premium storage account type for page blobs only.</li>
<li><strong>Premium - Block blobs</strong>: Premium storage account type for block blobs and append blobs.</li>
<li><strong>Premium - File shares</strong>: Premium storage account type for file shares only.</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft recommends that you use the <strong>Standard - StorageV2 (general purpose v2)</strong> option for new storage accounts.</p>
<p>The core advice is to choose the <strong>Resource Manager</strong> deployment model and the <strong>Standard - StorageV2 (general purpose v2)</strong> account kind for all your storage accounts. For new resources, there are few reasons to consider the other choices.</p>
<h1 id="choose-an-account-creation-tool">Choose an account creation tool<a class="headerlink" href="#choose-an-account-creation-tool" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>There are several tools that create a storage account. Your choice is typically based on if you want a GUI and whether you need automation.</p>
<h2 id="available-tools">Available tools<a class="headerlink" href="#available-tools" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The available tools are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure portal</li>
<li>Azure CLI (Command-line interface)</li>
<li>Azure PowerShell</li>
<li>Management client libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>The Azure portal provides a GUI with explanations for each setting, which makes it easy to use and helpful for learning about the options.</p>
<p>The other tools in this list all support automation. The Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell let you write scripts, while the management libraries allow you to incorporate the creation into a client app.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-choose-a-tool">How to choose a tool<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-choose-a-tool" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Storage accounts are typically based on an analysis of your data, so they tend to be relatively stable. As a result, storage-account creation is usually a one-time operation done at the start of a project. For one-time activities, the portal is the most common choice.</p>
<p>In the rare cases where you need automation, the decision is between a programmatic API or a scripting solution. Scripts are typically faster to create and less work to maintain because there's no need for an IDE, NuGet packages, or build steps. If you have an existing client application, the management libraries might be an attractive choice; otherwise, scripts are a better option.</p>

<p>In this unit, you use the Azure portal to create a storage account for a fictitious southern California surf report web app. The surf report site lets users upload photos and videos of local beach conditions. Viewers of the site use the content to help them choose the beach with the best surfing conditions.</p>
<p>Your list of design and feature goals is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video content must load quickly.</li>
<li>The site must handle unexpected spikes in upload volume.</li>
<li>Outdated content must be removed as surf conditions change so the site always shows current conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>You decide to buffer uploaded content in an Azure Queue for processing and then transfer it to an Azure Blob for persistent storage. You need a storage account that can hold both queues and blobs while delivering low-latency access to your content.</p>

<p>Azure Storage Explorer can access many different data types from services like these:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Azure Blob Storage</strong>: Blob storage is used to store unstructured data as a binary large object (blob).</li>
<li><strong>Azure Table Storage</strong>: Table storage is used to store NoSQL, semi-structured data.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Queue Storage</strong>: Queue storage is used to store messages in a queue, which applications can then access and process through HTTP(S) calls.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Files</strong>: Azure Files is a file-sharing service that enables access through the Server Message Block protocol, similar to traditional file servers.</li>
<li><strong>Azure Data Lake Storage</strong>: Azure Data Lake, based on Apache Hadoop, is designed for large data volumes and can store unstructured and structured data. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 is Azure Blob Storage with the hierarchical namespace feature enabled on the account.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="manage-multiple-storage-accounts-in-multiple-subscriptions">Manage multiple storage accounts in multiple subscriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#manage-multiple-storage-accounts-in-multiple-subscriptions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you have multiple storage accounts across multiple subscriptions in your Azure tenant, managing them through the Azure portal can be time consuming. Storage Explorer lets you manage the data stored in multiple Azure Storage accounts and across Azure subscriptions.</p>
<h3 id="use-local-emulators">Use local emulators<a class="headerlink" href="#use-local-emulators" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>During the development phase of your project, you might not want developers to incur additional costs by using Azure Storage accounts. In those cases, you can use a locally based emulator. Storage Explorer supports two emulators: Azure Storage Emulator and Azurite.</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure Storage Emulator uses a local instance of Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Express LocalDB. It emulates Azure Table, Queue, and Blob storage.</li>
<li>Azurite, which is based on Node.js, is an open-source emulator that supports most Azure Storage commands through an API.</li>
</ul>
<p>Storage Explorer requires the emulator to be running before you open it. Connecting to your emulator is no different than connecting to Azure Storage accounts, except that you'll choose the <strong>Attach to a local emulator</strong> connection type.</p>
<p>All locally emulated storage connection types appear in <strong>Local &amp; Attached</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage accounts</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="connecting-storage-explorer-to-azure">Connecting Storage Explorer to Azure<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-storage-explorer-to-azure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are several ways to connect your Storage Explorer application to your Azure Storage accounts.</p>
<p>You need two permissions to access your Azure Storage account: management and data. However, you can use Storage Explorer with only the data-layer permission. The data layer requires the user to be granted, at a minimum, a read data role. The nature of the read/write role should be specific to the type of data stored in the storage account. The data layer is used to access blobs, containers, and other data resources.</p>
<p>The management role grants access to view lists of your various storage accounts, containers, and service endpoints.</p>
<h3 id="connection-types">Connection types<a class="headerlink" href="#connection-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are many ways to connect an Azure Storage Explorer instance to your Azure resources. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add resources by using Microsoft Entra ID</li>
<li>Use a connection string</li>
<li>Use a shared access signature URI</li>
<li>Use a name and key</li>
<li>Attach to a local emulator</li>
<li>Attach to Azure Data Lake Storage by using a URI</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll explore a few of these connection types and provide an overview of the required steps to set up the connection.</p>
<h3 id="add-an-azure-account-by-using-microsoft-entra-id">Add an Azure account by using Microsoft Entra ID<a class="headerlink" href="#add-an-azure-account-by-using-microsoft-entra-id" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Use this connection type when the user can access the data layer. You can use it only to create a container. Connecting to Azure Storage through Microsoft Entra ID requires more configuration than the other methods. The account that you use to connect to Azure must have the correct permissions and authorization to access the target resources.</p>
<p>To add a resource by using Microsoft Entra ID:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Storage Explorer.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Sign in with Azure</strong> option and sign in to Azure.</li>
<li>Connect to your Azure Storage account.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add a resource via Microsoft Entra ID</strong>, and then choose the Azure tenant and the associated account.</li>
<li>When you're prompted, provide the type of resource that you're connecting to.</li>
<li>Review and verify the connection details, and then select <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's crucial to select the correct resource type because it changes the information that you need to enter.</p>
<p>Any connections that you create through this approach will appear in the resource tree, in this branch: <strong>Local &amp; attached</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Attached Containers</strong> &gt; <strong>Blob</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="connect-by-using-a-shared-access-signature-uri">Connect by using a shared access signature URI<a class="headerlink" href="#connect-by-using-a-shared-access-signature-uri" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A shared access signature (SAS) URI is an unambiguous identifier that's used to access your Azure Storage resources.</p>
<p>With this connection method, you'll use a SAS URI for the required storage account. You'll need a SAS URI whether you want to use a file share, table, queue, or blob container. You can get a SAS URI either from the Azure portal or from Storage Explorer. For more information, see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/create-account-sas?redirectedfrom=MSDN">Create an account SAS</a>.</p>
<p>To add a SAS connection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Storage Explorer.</li>
<li>Connect to your Azure Storage account.</li>
<li>Select the connection type: <strong>Shared access signature URI (SAS)</strong>.</li>
<li>Provide a meaningful name for the connection.</li>
<li>Provide the Service URL.</li>
<li>Review and verify the connection details, and then select <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you've added a connection, it appears in the resource tree as a new node. You'll find the connection node in this branch: <strong>Local &amp; attached</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Attached Container</strong> &gt; <strong>Service</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="connect-by-using-a-storage-account-name-and-key">Connect by using a storage account name and key<a class="headerlink" href="#connect-by-using-a-storage-account-name-and-key" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>To connect to a storage account on Azure quickly, you use the account key that's associated with the storage. To find the storage access keys from the Azure portal, go to the correct storage account page and select <strong>access keys</strong>.</p>
<p>To add a connection:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Storage Explorer.</li>
<li>Connect to your Azure Storage account.</li>
<li>Select the connection type: <strong>Storage account name and key</strong>.</li>
<li>Provide a meaningful name for the connection.</li>
<li>When you're prompted, provide the name of the storage account and either of the account keys needed to access it.</li>
<li>From the provided list, select the storage domain that you want to use.</li>
<li>Review and verify the connection details, and then select <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the connection is added, it appears in the resource tree as a connection node. The connection node is in this branch: <strong>Local &amp; attached</strong> &gt; <strong>Storage Accounts</strong>.</p>

<p>Containers have specific rules that govern how they can be named. They must begin and end with either a letter or a number, must be all lowercase, and can have numbers and hyphens. The name can't contain a double hyphen.</p>
<p>Name this new queue <strong>myqueue</strong> and press Enter to create the queue. Each created queue appears on a tab to the right of the resource tree.</p>

<p>You've worked through the basics of connecting Storage Explorer to your Azure account. In the CRM system, your developers use Data Lake Storage for big-data storage. You want to use Storage Explorer to connect to it.</p>
<p>Azure Data Lake Storage is used for storing and analyzing large data sets. It supports large data workloads. It's well suited to capture data of any type or size, and at any speed. Data Lake Storage features all the expected enterprise-grade capabilities like security, scalability, reliability, manageability, and availability.</p>
<p>There are two types of Azure Data Lake Storage: Gen1 and Gen2. Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 has been retired; follow the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/action-required-switch-to-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2-by-29-february-2024/">Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 migration guidance</a> for existing Gen1 accounts.</p>
<p>You can use Storage Explorer to connect to Data Lake accounts. Just like with storage accounts, you can use Storage Explorer to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create, delete, and manage containers.</li>
<li>Upload, manage, and administer blobs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's create Azure Data Lake Storage, then use Storage Explorer to connect to it.</p>

<p>Data comes in different shapes and sizes. No single storage solution fits all data. For example, an online retail website has multiple, distinct datasets that are all used to run the business. Datasets include product catalog data, media files like photos and videos, and financial business data. Each dataset has different requirements. It's your job to figure out which storage solution is best. The key factors to consider in deciding on the optimal storage solution are how to classify your data, how your data will be used, and how you can get the best performance for your application.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives_6">Learning objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-objectives_6" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>

<p>An online retail business has different types of data. Each type of data might benefit from a different storage solution.</p>
<p>Application data can be classified in one of three ways: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Here, you'll learn how to classify your data so that you can choose the appropriate storage solution for the type of data.</p>
<h2 id="approaches-to-storing-data-in-the-cloud">Approaches to storing data in the cloud<a class="headerlink" href="#approaches-to-storing-data-in-the-cloud" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The following video introduces your options for storing data in the cloud:  </p>
<h3 id="structured-data">Structured data<a class="headerlink" href="#structured-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>In structured data, sometimes called <em>relational data</em>, all data has the same fields or properties. All the data has the same organization and shape, or <em>schema</em>. The shared schema allows this type of data to be easily searched by using query languages like Structured Query Language (SQL). This capability makes this data style perfect for applications like CRM systems, reservations, and inventory management.</p>
<p>Structured data often is stored in database tables with rows and columns. In the table, a key column indicates how one row in a table relates to data in another row of another table. In the following image, a table that has data about grades gets data from a table of student names and a table of class data by using key columns.</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram that shows two structured data tables and a relationship table that has data that ties them together." src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/choose-storage-approach-in-azure/media/relational-database.png" /></p>
<p>Structured data is straightforward in that it's easy to enter, query, and analyze. All the data is in the same format. However, forcing a consistent structure also means that the evolution of the data is more difficult. If you add or remove data fields, you must update each record to conform to the new structure.</p>
<h3 id="semi-structured-data">Semi-structured data<a class="headerlink" href="#semi-structured-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Semi-structured data is less organized than structured data. Semi-structured data isn't stored in a relational format because the fields don't fit neatly into tables, rows, and columns. Semi-structured data contains tags that make the organization and hierarchy of the data apparent. One example is key/value pairs. Semi-structured data is also referred to as non-relational or <em>not only SQL (NoSQL)</em> data.</p>
<p>A data serialization language defines semi-structured data. In data classification, <em>serialization</em> is the process of converting data into a format that can be transmitted or stored.</p>
<p>Software developers use data serialization languages to write data stored in memory to a file, which can then be sent to another system, parsed, and read. The sender and receiver don't need to know details about the other system. Both systems can understand the data if using the same serialization language.  </p>
<h3 id="common-serialization-languages">Common serialization languages<a class="headerlink" href="#common-serialization-languages" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Three common serialization languages are XML, JSON, and YAML.</p>
<h4 id="xml">XML<a class="headerlink" href="#xml" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><em>Extensible Markup Language (XML)</em> was one of the first data languages to be widely used. XML is text-based, which makes it easily human-readable and machine-readable. XML parsers are available for almost all popular development platforms.</p>
<p>You can use XML to express relationships. XML has standards for schema, transformation, and even displaying on the web.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a person's name, age, and hobbies expressed in XML:</p>
<p>XMLCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&lt;Person Age=&quot;23&quot;&gt;
    &lt;FirstName&gt;Quinn&lt;/FirstName&gt;
    &lt;LastName&gt;Anderson&lt;/LastName&gt;
    &lt;Hobbies&gt;
        &lt;Hobby Type=&quot;Sports&quot;&gt;Golf&lt;/Hobby&gt;
        &lt;Hobby Type=&quot;Leisure&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/Hobby&gt;
        &lt;Hobby Type=&quot;Leisure&quot;&gt;Guitar&lt;/Hobby&gt;
   &lt;/Hobbies&gt;
&lt;/Person&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>XML expresses the shape of the data by using <em>tags</em> that are defined inside angle braces. The tags come in two forms: <em>elements</em> such as <code>&lt;FirstName&gt;</code> and <em>attributes</em> that can be expressed in text like <code>Age="23"</code>. Elements can have child elements to express relationships. For example, the <code>&lt;Hobbies&gt;</code> tag expresses a collection of <code>Hobby</code> elements.</p>
<p>XML is flexible and can express complex data easily. However, it tends to be more verbose, which makes it larger to store, process, and pass over a network. As a result, other formats have become more popular.</p>
<h4 id="json">JSON<a class="headerlink" href="#json" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><em>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</em> has a lightweight specification and uses curly braces to indicate data structure. Compared to XML, JSON is less verbose, and it's easier for humans to read. JSON frequently is used by web services to return data.</p>
<p>Here's the same person's name, age, and hobbies expressed in JSON:</p>
<p>JSONCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>{
    &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Quinn&quot;,
    &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Anderson&quot;,
    &quot;age&quot;: &quot;23&quot;,
    &quot;hobbies&quot;: [
        { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Sports&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Golf&quot; },
        { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Leisure&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Reading&quot; },
        { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Leisure&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Guitar&quot; }
    ]
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The JSON format isn't as formal as XML. It's closer to a key/value pair model than to a formal data expression. As you might guess from the name, the JavaScript programming language has built-in support for this format, so it's popular for web development. Like XML, other languages have parsers you can use to work with this data format. The downside of JSON is that it tends to be more programmer-oriented, so it's harder for non-technical people to read and modify.</p>
<h4 id="yaml">YAML<a class="headerlink" href="#yaml" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p><em>YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)</em> is a more recently developed data serialization language. One of the benefits of using YAML is that it's easier for humans to read than some other languages. Line separation and indentation define the data structure. The YAML format reduces the dependency on structural characters like parentheses, commas, and brackets.</p>
<p>Here's the same data expressed in YAML:</p>
<p>YAMLCopy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>firstName: Quinn
lastName: Anderson
age: 23
hobbies:
    - type: Sports
      value: Golf
    - type: Leisure
      value: Reading
    - type: Leisure
      value: Guitar
</code></pre></div>
<p>This format is more readable than JSON. Configuration files that people write but programs parse is a common use for it. YAML is the newest of these data formats.</p>
<p>It's often used for configuration files written by people but parsed by programs.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-semi-structured-or-nosql-data">What is semi-structured or NoSQL data?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-semi-structured-or-nosql-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The following video describes semi-structured data and NoSQL data storage options:  </p>
<h3 id="unstructured-data">Unstructured data<a class="headerlink" href="#unstructured-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The organization of unstructured data is undefined. Unstructured data is often delivered in file format, such as in photo or video files. The video file itself might have an overall structure and come with semi-structured metadata, but the data that forms the video itself is unstructured. Therefore, photos, videos, and other similar files are classified as unstructured data.</p>
<p>Examples of unstructured data include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media files, like photos, videos, and audio files.</li>
<li>Microsoft 365 files, like Word documents.</li>
<li>Text files.</li>
<li>Log files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-classification-evaluate-your-data-types">Data classification: Evaluate your data types<a class="headerlink" href="#data-classification-evaluate-your-data-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>You can classify data in one of three ways: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Understanding the differences so that you can classify your data helps you choose the correct storage solution.</p>
<p>Structured data is organized data that neatly fits into tables or columns of data. Semi-structured data is still organized and has clear properties and values, but there's variety to the data. Unstructured data doesn't fit neatly into tables or columns, and it doesn't have a uniform schema.</p>
<p>Let's look at the datasets used in an online retail business and classify them.</p>
<h3 id="product-catalog-data">Product catalog data<a class="headerlink" href="#product-catalog-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Product catalog data for an online retail business is semi-structured in nature. Each product has a product SKU, a description, a quantity, a price, size options, color options, a photo, and possibly a video. This data appears relational to begin with because it all has the same structure. However, as you introduce new products or different kinds of products, you might want to add data fields. For example, new tennis shoes you carry are Bluetooth-enabled to relay sensor data from the shoe to a fitness app on the user's phone. This feature appears to be a growing trend, and you want to give customers the option to filter on "Bluetooth-enabled" shoes. You don't want to update all your existing shoe data with a Bluetooth-enabled property. You want to add this new property only to new shoes.</p>
<p>With the addition of the Bluetooth-enabled property, your shoe data is no longer homogenous. You've introduced differences in the schema. If this change is the only exception you expect to encounter, you can normalize the existing data so that all products included a "Bluetooth-enabled" field to maintain a structured, relational organization. However, if it's just one of many specialty fields that you envision supporting in the future, the classification of the data is semi-structured. Tags organize the data, but each product in the catalog can contain unique fields.</p>
<p>The classification for product catalog data is <em>semi-structured</em>.</p>
<h3 id="photos-and-videos">Photos and videos<a class="headerlink" href="#photos-and-videos" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The photos and videos displayed on product pages are unstructured data. Although the media file might contain metadata, the body of the media file is unstructured.</p>
<p>The data classification for photos and videos is <em>unstructured</em>.</p>
<h3 id="business-data">Business data<a class="headerlink" href="#business-data" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Business analysts want to implement business intelligence to perform inventory pipeline evaluations and sales data reviews. To perform these operations, data from multiple months needs to be aggregated and then queried. Because of the need to aggregate similar data, this data must be structured, so that one month can be compared to the next.</p>
<p>The classification for business data is <em>structured</em>.</p>
<h1 id="determine-operational-needs">Determine operational needs<a class="headerlink" href="#determine-operational-needs" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>After you've identified the kind of data you want to store (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured), the next step is to determine how you'll use the data. For example, as an online retailer, you know that customers need quick access to product data, and business users need to run complex analytical queries. As you work through these requirements, taking your data classification into account, you can begin to plan your data storage solution.</p>
<p>Here, you'll answer some questions to help you determine what to do with your data.</p>
<h2 id="operations-and-latency">Operations and latency<a class="headerlink" href="#operations-and-latency" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>What are the main operations you'll be completing on each data type, and what are the performance requirements for the data?</p>
<p>Ask these questions about your data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will you be doing simple lookups by using an ID field?</li>
<li>Do you need to query the database for one or more fields?</li>
<li>How many create, update, and delete operations do you expect to run?</li>
<li>Do you need to run complex analytical queries?</li>
<li>How quickly do these operations need to process?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answers to these questions will help you decide on the best storage solution for your data.</p>
<h2 id="operations-and-latency-evaluate-your-data-types">Operations and latency: Evaluate your data types<a class="headerlink" href="#operations-and-latency-evaluate-your-data-types" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Let's walk through each of the datasets with these questions in mind and discuss the requirements.</p>
<h3 id="product-catalog-data_1">Product catalog data<a class="headerlink" href="#product-catalog-data_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>For product catalog data in an online retail scenario, customer needs are the highest priority. Customers will want to query the product catalog to find an item or category they have in mind. For example, a customer might query all tennis shoes, then tennis shoes on sale, and then tennis shoes on sale in a particular size. Customer needs might require many read operations, and they must be able to query on specific fields.</p>
<p>When a customer places an order, the application must update product quantities. The update operations need to happen as quickly as the read operations so that users don't put an item in their shopping carts when that item just sold out. The application must support not only a large number of read operations, but it also requires increased write operations for product catalog data. Be sure to determine the priorities for all the users of the database, not only the primary users.</p>
<h3 id="photos-and-videos_1">Photos and videos<a class="headerlink" href="#photos-and-videos_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Photos and videos that are displayed on product pages have different requirements. They need fast retrieval times so that they're displayed on the site at the same time as product catalog data, but they don't need to be queried independently. Instead, you can rely on the results of the product query, and include the video ID or URL as a property on the product data. You need to retrieve photos and videos using their IDs only.</p>
<p>Customers won't make updates to existing photos or videos, but they can add new photos for product reviews. For example, a customer might upload an image of them wearing their new shoes.</p>
<p>As an employee, you also upload and delete product photos that are provided by your product vendor. But those updates don't need to happen as quickly as your other product data updates.</p>
<p>In summary, you can query photos and videos by ID to return the entire file. However, create and update operations are less frequent and have lower priority.</p>
<h3 id="business-data_1">Business data<a class="headerlink" href="#business-data_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>For data analysis, the company uses only historical data. No original data is updated based on the analysis, so business data is read-only. Users don't expect their complex analytics to run instantly, so it's acceptable to have some latency in the results.</p>
<p>Business data is stored in multiple datasets. Not all business analysts need write access to all datasets, but all business analysts can read from all datasets.</p>
<h1 id="group-multiple-operations-in-a-transaction">Group multiple operations in a transaction<a class="headerlink" href="#group-multiple-operations-in-a-transaction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>If a change to one piece of data must result in a change to another piece of data, an application needs to group together a series of data updates. You can use <em>transactions</em> to group these updates. In a transaction, if one event in a series of updates fails, the entire series can be rolled back or undone.</p>
<p>An example is an online retailer that uses a transaction to place an order, verify payment, and update the product inventory. Grouping the related events ensures that you don't reduce your inventory levels until you receive an approved form of payment.</p>
<p>Next, learn about transactions and whether they're required for your data.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-transaction">What is a transaction?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-transaction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A transaction is a logical group of database operations that run together.</p>
<p>Here's the question to ask yourself regarding whether you need to use transactions in your application: Will a change to one piece of data in your dataset affect another piece of data? If the answer is yes, you'll need support for transactions in your database service.</p>
<p><em>ACID guarantees</em> define transactions by ensuring a set of four requirements are met. ACID is an acronym for <em>atomicity</em>, <em>consistency</em>, <em>isolation</em>, and <em>durability</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Atomicity</em> means a transaction must run exactly once, and it must be atomic. Either all of the work is done or none of it is. Operations within a transaction usually share a common intent and are interdependent.</li>
<li><em>Consistency</em> ensures that the data is consistent both before and after the transaction.</li>
<li><em>Isolation</em> ensures that each transaction is unaffected by other transactions.</li>
<li><em>Durability</em> means that changes made as a result of a transaction are permanently saved in the system. The system saves data that's committed so even in the event of a failure and system restart, the data is available in its correct state.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a database offers ACID guarantees, these principles are consistently applied to each transaction.</p>
<h3 id="oltp-vs-olap">OLTP vs. OLAP<a class="headerlink" href="#oltp-vs-olap" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Transactional databases are often called <em>online transaction processing (OLTP)</em> systems. OLTP systems commonly support many users, have quick response times, and handle large volumes of data. They also are highly available, which means they have minimal downtime. OLTP systems typically handle small transactions or relatively simple transactions.</p>
<p>An example of an Azure service that supports OLTP is Azure SQL Database.</p>
<p><em>Online analytical processing (OLAP)</em> systems commonly support fewer users, have longer response times, can be less available, and typically handle large transactions or complex transactions.</p>
<p>An example of an Azure service that supports OLAP is Azure Analysis Services.</p>
<p>The terms OLTP and OLAP aren't used as frequently as they used to be, but understanding them makes it easier to categorize the needs of your application.</p>

<p>Ensuring that your data is in the correct state isn't always an easy task. Transactions can help by enforcing data integrity requirements on your data. If your data benefits from ACID principles, choose a storage solution that supports transactions.</p>
<p>Let's walk through each of the datasets in the online retail scenario and determine the need for transactions.</p>
<h3 id="product-catalog-data_2">Product catalog data<a class="headerlink" href="#product-catalog-data_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Product catalog data should be stored in a transactional database. When a user places an order and the payment is verified, the item inventory should be updated. Likewise, if the customer's credit card is declined, the order should be rolled back and the inventory shouldn't be updated. These relationships require transactions.</p>
<h3 id="photos-and-videos_2">Photos and videos<a class="headerlink" href="#photos-and-videos_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Photos and videos in a product catalog don't require transactional support. These files are changed only when an update is made or new files are added. Even though there's a relationship between the image and the actual product data, it's not transactional in nature.</p>
<h3 id="business-data_2">Business data<a class="headerlink" href="#business-data_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Because business data is historical and unchanging, transactional support isn't required. Business analysts who work with the data also have unique query needs. They often work with aggregates in their queries, so they can work with the totals of other smaller data points.</p>
<h1 id="choose-a-storage-solution-on-azure">Choose a storage solution on Azure<a class="headerlink" href="#choose-a-storage-solution-on-azure" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h1>
<p>Choosing the correct storage solution can lead to better performance, cost savings, and improved manageability. Each type of data has different storage requirements. It's your job to determine which storage solution is best for the types of data your company uses. Always consider the type of data, the operations required, expected latency, and the need for transactional support.</p>
<p>Here, you apply what you've learned about the data in your online retail scenario and find the best Azure service for each dataset.</p>
<h2 id="product-catalog-data_3">Product catalog data<a class="headerlink" href="#product-catalog-data_3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Data classification</strong>: Semi-structured because of the need to extend or modify the schema for new products.</p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong>: Customers require a high number of read operations, with the ability to query many fields within the database. Also, the business requires a high number of write operations to track its constantly changing inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Latency and throughput</strong>: High throughput and low latency.</p>
<p><strong>Transactional support</strong>: Because product data is tied to payment and inventory, transactional support is required.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-service-azure-cosmos-db">Recommended service: Azure Cosmos DB<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-service-azure-cosmos-db" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Cosmos DB supports semi-structured or NoSQL data by design. So, supporting new fields like the "Bluetooth-enabled" field or any new fields you need in the future is something you can do with Azure Cosmos DB.</p>
<p>Azure Cosmos DB supports SQL for queries, and every property is indexed by default. You can create queries so that your customers can filter on any property in the catalog.</p>
<p>Azure Cosmos DB is also ACID-compliant, so you can be assured that your transactions are completed according to those strict requirements. An OLTP connector is available for Azure Cosmos DB.</p>
<p>As an added plus, you also can use Azure Cosmos DB to easily replicate your data anywhere in the world. If your e-commerce site has users concentrated in the US, France, and England, you can replicate your data to datacenters in those regions. Latency is reduced because you've physically moved the data closer to your users.</p>
<p>Even with data that's replicated around the world, you can choose from one of five consistency levels. By choosing the right consistency level, you can determine the tradeoffs to make between consistency, availability, latency, and throughput. You can scale up to handle higher customer demand during peak shopping times or scale down during slower times to conserve on cost.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-other-azure-services">Why not other Azure services?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-other-azure-services" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Azure SQL Database would be an excellent choice for this dataset if you could identify the subset of properties that are common for most of the products and the variable properties that might not exist in some products. You can use Azure SQL Database to combine structured data in the columns and semi-structured data stored as JSON columns that can be easily extended. Azure SQL Database can provide many of the same benefits of Azure Cosmos DB. However, it provides little benefit if the structure of your data is changing in different entities, and you can't predefine a set of common properties that are repeated in most of the entities. Unlike Azure Cosmos DB, which indexes every property in the documents, Azure SQL Database needs to explicitly define what properties in semi-structured documents should be indexed. Azure Cosmos DB is a better choice for highly unstructured and variable data in which you can't predict what properties should be indexed. Azure SQL Database supports OLTP.</p>
<p>Other Azure services, like Azure Table storage, Apache HBase in Azure HDInsight, and Azure Cache for Redis, can also store NoSQL data. In this scenario, users will want to query on multiple fields, so Azure Cosmos DB is a better fit. Azure Cosmos DB indexes every field by default, whereas other Azure services are limited in the data they index. Querying on non-indexed fields results in reduced performance.</p>
<h2 id="photos-and-videos_3">Photos and videos<a class="headerlink" href="#photos-and-videos_3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Data classification</strong>: Unstructured.</p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong>: Retrieve only by ID, customers require a high number of read operations with low latency, and create operations and update operations will be less frequent and can have higher latency than read operations.</p>
<p><strong>Latency and throughput</strong>: Retrievals by ID need to support low latency and high throughput. Create operations and update operations can have higher latency than read operations.</p>
<p><strong>Transactional support</strong>: Not required.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-service-azure-blob-storage">Recommended service: Azure Blob Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-service-azure-blob-storage" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Azure Blob Storage supports storing files like photos and videos. It also works with Azure Content Delivery Network by caching the most frequently used content, and then storing it on edge servers. Azure Content Delivery Network reduces latency when serving those images to your users.</p>
<p>In Azure Blob Storage, you can also move images from the hot storage tier to the cool storage tier or archive storage tier. This helps reduce costs and focus throughput on the most frequently viewed images and videos.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-other-azure-services_1">Why not other Azure services?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-other-azure-services_1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>You could upload your images to Azure App Service, so that the same server running your app serves up your images. This solution would work if you didn't have many files. But if you have lots of files and a global audience, you'll get better performance by using Azure Blob Storage with Azure Content Delivery Network.</p>
<h2 id="business-data_3">Business data<a class="headerlink" href="#business-data_3" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Data classification</strong>: Structured.</p>
<p><strong>Operations</strong>: Read-only, complex analytical queries across multiple databases.</p>
<p><strong>Latency and throughput</strong>: Some latency in the results is expected based on the complex nature of the queries.</p>
<p><strong>Transactional support</strong>: Not required.</p>
<h3 id="recommended-service-azure-sql-database">Recommended service: Azure SQL Database<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-service-azure-sql-database" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Business analysts most likely will query business data using SQL, as they are more knowledgeable in this query language than any other. You can use Azure SQL Database as a solution by itself. However, if you pair it with Azure Analysis Services, data analysts can create a semantic model over the data in Azure SQL Database. Data analysts can then share the model with business users, who need only to connect to the model from any business intelligence (BI) tool to immediately explore the data and gain insights. Azure Analysis Services supports OLAP.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-other-azure-services_2">Why not other Azure services?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-other-azure-services_2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Azure Synapse Analytics supports OLAP solutions and SQL queries, but your business analysts will need to perform cross-database queries, which Azure Synapse Analytics doesn't support.</p>
<p>Azure Stream Analytics is a great way to analyze data and transform it into actionable insights, but its focus is on real-time data that is streaming in. In this scenario, the business analysts are looking at historical data only.</p>
